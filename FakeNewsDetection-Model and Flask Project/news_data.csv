30,Biden Meets With Turkeys Who’ve Lost Loved Ones To Thanksgiving,"WASHINGTON—Looking into the birds’ eyes and placing a hand on their shoulders, President Joe Biden met at the White House with a group of turkeys who had lost their loved ones to Thanksgiving, White House sources confirmed Wednesday. “There, there–you’ll be all right,” said Biden, kneeling down to the floor to embrace the birds, who were heard gobbling in sorrow as they mourned the countless friends and family members they had lost to the national holiday. “I’ve gone through my own share of grief, so I know exactly how you feel. Losing a member of the flock is never easy. You can call me up any time, and I’ll be here for you. I promise you: They didn’t die for nothing.” At press time, Biden had reportedly presented the surviving turkeys with the prestigious Purple Giblet.",FAKE
13,"The ‘Bidenomics’ plan, explained","Move over, Reaganomics. President Joe Biden is attempting to usher in the era of “Bidenomics.” This economic theory – which rejects the idea of “trickle-down” policies in favor of focusing on the middle class – will be a centerpiece of Biden’s 2024 reelection campaign. The president highlighted the achievements he’s attributing to Bidenomics in a major speech in Chicago on Wednesday. Growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down – is Biden’s mantra. “When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy still do, everybody does well,” Biden said, noting that the media came up with the name Bidenomics. “This vision is a fundamental break from the economic theories that failed America’s middle class for decades now.” Trickle-down economics, which was at the heart of President Ronald Reagan’s policies and continues to be the guiding light of Republican lawmakers, typically revolves around tax cuts for the wealthy and large companies. Supporters say the benefits flow down to middle-class and working Americans, boosting economic growth more broadly. But many experts dispute the effectiveness of this practice at lifting all boats. Biden argues that supply-side, trickle-down economics has cost jobs and hollowed out the middle class. He has long focused on that group of Americans, serving as chair of the Middle Class Task Force when he was vice president in the Obama administration. “Folks, let me say it as clearly as I can: (The) trickle-down approach failed the middle class and failed America,” said Biden. To fund Bidenomics, the president once again calls for ensuring the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Biden, however, is still struggling to sell his economic agenda to the public. Two-thirds of Americans disapprove of how he’s handled the economy and just over three-quarters feel the economy is in poor shape, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in May. The administration and several officials have provided an outline of what Bidenomics entails. A fact sheet distributed by the White House lists the president’s efforts to date but does not include any new initiatives. Here are three key principles of Bidenomics: The Biden administration has focused on infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors, Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, said at Tuesday’s White House press briefing. The efforts aim to attract private investment, according to the fact sheet. Since Biden took office in 2021 they have already spurred nearly $500 billion in private-sector commitments. One example: The administration is touting the fact that construction spending on manufacturing facilities has doubled since 2021. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS Act each included direct funding and tax incentives for public and private manufacturing construction. This surge is not happening in other advanced economies, it notes. Also, earlier this week, Biden outlined how states will receive more than $42 billion in federal funding for high-speed internet service, which was part of the 2021 infrastructure law. It is aimed at bringing connectivity to more Americans and closing the digital divide. The administration is comparing it to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Rural Electrification Act, which brought electricity to homes throughout the country. And 35,000 new projects – including roads, bridges and ports – have received funding through the bipartisan infrastructure law, the White House said. The Biden administration has also taken steps to prepare workers for the jobs of the future, including those that don’t need four-year college degrees, Brainard said. The president has supported unions and created apprenticeships. He recently visited a North Carolina community college to discuss job training in advanced manufacturing and noted the $500 million investment in the Good Jobs Challenge, which stems from the American Rescue Plan. Biden is taking credit for the 13 million jobs that have been created since he took office and the long stretch of a near-historically low unemployment rate, as well as the record low rates for African- and Hispanic-Americans and people with disabilities. It should be noted that Biden took office in January 2021 in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic, which unleashed economic upheaval as many Americans stayed home. The administration also says the share of working-age Americans in the labor force is higher now than it has been in more than 20 years. The jobs also come with better pay, better benefits and better schedules as employers seek to attract and retain workers, according to a memo circulated Monday by two of the president’s senior advisers, Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon. The president has also focused on boosting competition to reduce costs and level the playing field for small businesses. The administration points to his signing an executive order in 2021 to ban or limit non-compete clauses. The Federal Trade Commission in January proposed a rule to ban employers from imposing noncompete agreements on workers and to rescind all existing agreements. Also, Biden officials have highlighted the Inflation Reduction Act provision that reduces insulin costs for Medicare enrollees to $35 a month, as well as the president’s proposal targeting so-called junk fees.

47,"Koch network raises more than $70 million, launches new anti-Trump ads in early voting states","The influential network associated with conservative billionaire Charles Koch has collected more than $70 million for political races, the group announced Thursday, as it gears up to help shape the outcome of next year’s contests up and down the ballot and encourage Republican voters to bypass former President Donald Trump in the White House nomination fight. Americans for Prosperity Action has pledged to back a single contender in the GOP presidential primary for the first time in its history. It has not yet announced whom it will support, but the group could dramatically reshape the Republican field by deploying its vast resources and standing army of conservative activists on behalf of a single candidate. The sums raised by the group will help advance those efforts. The lion’s share of the total announced Thursday came from two organizations affiliated with Koch: $25 million from his Kansas-based industrial conglomerate Koch Industries, and another $25 million from Stand Together, a nonprofit he founded, AFP Action spokesman Bill Riggs confirmed. The New York Times first reported the fundraising total. Koch network plans to back a Republican -- other than Donald Trump -- in the 2024 presidential primary The group is also launching new digital spots, shared first with CNN, that cast Trump as a candidate Republicans can’t risk supporting in 2024. “Instead of making (President Joe) Biden answer for his reckless progressive agenda, Trump makes the debate about indictments, personal grievances and the election he lost,” one 30-second spot, titled “The Choice,” says. The second, called “Unelectable,” describes Trump as a serial loser who caused Republicans to lose the House, Senate and the White House. “If Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, we could lose everything,” the narrator says. The ads will run in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, officials said. “President Trump continues to fight against the swampy D.C. insiders who would love nothing more than to have an establishment puppet they can control in the White House,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in an email. “No amount of dirty money from shady lobbyists and mysterious donors will ever stop the America First movement, and that’s why President Trump continues to dominate poll after poll — both nationally and statewide. We welcome this fight.” AFP Action on Thursday also announced its first US House endorsements of the cycle, saying it will back Republican Reps. Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Young Kim of California, Zach Nunn of Iowa and John James of Michigan, along with former GOP Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico. In addition to attempting to stir doubts about Trump among the GOP faithful, network officials have said part of their 2024 strategy is to bring more general election voters into the GOP primary process to alter the outcome of early contests. Americans for Prosperity already has reached out to 1.4 million potential new Republican and swing voters in nearly a dozen states, officials said. In a statement to CNN earlier this month, Americans for Prosperity CEO Emily Seidel said the group’s voter interactions have demonstrated to it that many Trump supporters are “receptive to arguments that he is a weak candidate, his focus on 2020 is a liability, and his lack of appeal with independent voters is a problem.” “That tells us that many Republicans are ready to move on, they just need to see another candidate step up and show they can lead and win,” she added.

12,Mayorkas taps new ICE leadership,"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has tapped Patrick “P.J.” Lechleitner, a career official, to serve in an acting capacity as the new leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a notice sent to congressional staffers. “In compliance with legal requirements, Mr. Lechleitner will serve in his new leadership role as the Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director. Prior to this new position, Mr. Lechleitner led Homeland Security Investigations,” the notice stated. It’s the latest personnel move within the department’s key immigration agencies and comes after the announcement that Tae Johnson would step down. Johnson led ICE in an acting capacity under the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, after failed attempts to appoint a new director to the agency. According to his ICE biography, Lechleitner “served in key leadership positions” for Homeland Security Investigations and earlier in his career, was a Fairfax County police officer and served as a Navy signals intelligence specialist supporting national security interests. ICE hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed director since the Obama administration. Biden’s pick to lead the agency withdrew his nomination after a drawn-out process in the Senate. Earlier this year, US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz also announced he would be retiring at the end of June after more than three decades with the agency. Ortiz, who became chief in August 2021, led the agency as it faced a number of challenges in recent years, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the expiration of the pandemic-era public health restriction Title 42.

54,Top Trump campaign aide Susie Wiles met numerous times with special counsel investigators in documents probe,"A senior campaign official for Donald Trump was allegedly shown a classified map by the former president during a meeting at his New Jersey golf club after Trump left office, according to a source familiar with the matter. The campaign adviser, Susie Wiles, has spoken to federal investigators numerous times as part of the special counsel’s Mar-a-Lago documents probe, multiple sources told CNN. Wiles is not named in Jack Smith’s indictment of Trump, but a source familiar with the matter identified her as the “representative of his political action committee” who is referenced in the indictment. During her interviews, sources say that prosecutors repeatedly asked Wiles about whether Trump showed her classified documents. They also inquired about a map and whether she had any knowledge regarding documents related to Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, one source added. The indictment alleges that Trump showed classified documents to people on two separate occasions. According to the indictment, Trump was at his Bedminster club in August or September of 2021 and “showed a representative of his political action committee who did not possess a security clearance a classified map related to a military operation and told the representative that he should not be showing it to the representative and that the representative should not get too close.” The other incident, which CNN first reported, also occurred at Bedminster, where Trump repeatedly referenced a classified document during a meeting with two staffers and two individuals working on a Mark Meadows memoir. CNN obtained the audio of that meeting earlier this week. ABC News previously identified Wiles as the individual to whom Trump allegedly showed a classified map. Wiles, one of Trump’s closest advisers, is effectively running his third bid for the presidency and has taken an active role in Trump’s legal strategy, including helping find lawyers and helping arrange payment to attorneys representing Trump associates being questioned in the multiple federal and state investigations into the former president. Wiles is also a close associate of Chris Kise, who is on Trump’s legal team and appeared in court earlier this month when Trump was indicted. Sources in Trump’s inner circle tell CNN they were blindsided by the news. Wiles declined to comment to CNN. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told CNN that Wiles would not be taking a step back from the campaign. “Jack Smith and the Special Counsel’s investigation is openly engaging in outright election interference and meddling by attacking one of the leaders of President Trump’s re-election campaign,” said Cheung.

5,Biden administration announces more than $3 billion in funding to tackle homelessness with veterans focus,"The Biden administration announced new actions Thursday to help prevent and reduce veteran homelessness across the country, including $3.1 billion in funding to support efforts to quickly rehouse homeless Americans. “These funds can be used for a wide range of critical interventions from rental assistance to supportive services to technology and data sharing,” said White House domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden, referring to the funding that will be made available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Continuum of Care program. Additional actions being announced Thursday, according to a White House fact sheet, include: $11.5 million in funding for legal services for veterans experiencing homelessness; $58 million worth of funding to help homeless veterans find jobs; and a new series of “boot camps” by HUD and Veterans Affairs to help VA medical centers and public housing agencies more quickly rehouse veterans. The more than $3 billion in funding being announced by HUD is not specifically earmarked for veterans, although it will also go toward helping veterans struggling with homelessness, according to senior administration officials. “We like to say here that the phrase, homeless veteran, should not exist in the English language. Ending veteran homelessness has been and continues to be a top priority of the president and his relentless advocacy for that goal has led to very important investments and advancements, including robust funding,” said Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, who added that the VA is currently on track to meet its goal of rehousing 38,000 veterans in 2023. The VA put 40,401 homeless veterans into permanent housing last year with 2,443 of them returning to homelessness at some point that same year, according to the VA. While Thursday’s actions focus on the issue of homelessness for veterans, administration officials hope that progress made in rehousing former service members will help improve efforts to tackle the issue for all Americans experiencing homelessness. “Homelessness is a challenge we face as a nation. But most importantly, it is a solvable one,” Tanden told reporters, adding: “There are so many lessons there, that can help us tackle this problem for all Americans.” The $58 million in grant funding comes from the Department of Labor Veterans’ Employment and Training Service and will help veterans learn occupational skills, participate in on-the-job training or apprenticeships and provide other support services to reintegrate into the workforce. The $11.5 million in legal services grants is a “first-of-its-kind,” according to the White House, and will help veterans obtain representation in landlord-tenant disputes, as well as assist with other court proceedings like child support, custody or estate planning. “Legal support can be the difference between becoming homeless in the first instance, or having a safe stable house and a roof over their heads,” McDonough said. President Joe Biden has made it a goal of his administration to reduce homelessness by 25% for all Americans by 2025, calling on the country in his State of the Union address this year to do more, including “helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.” ",REAL
51,Former Ohio House speaker sentenced to 20 years in $60 million bribery scheme,"A former Republican speaker of Ohio’s House of Representatives was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison for his role in a $60 million bribery scheme. Larry Householder was convicted by a federal grand jury in March on racketeering conspiracy charges in connection with a scheme to accept bribes in exchange for ensuring the passage of a billion-dollar bailout for a nuclear energy company. “We are deeply disappointed in the court’s sentence which we believe was unduly harsh and failed to adequately take into consideration all of Larry’s good deeds in the community over the course of his lifetime,” Householder’s attorney Steve Bradley told CNN in an email. “We are also disappointed that Larry was not permitted to self surrender to begin serving his sentence. We will vigorously pursue an appeal with the hope of winning a new trial.” Former Ohio Republican Party Chair Matthew Borges was also convicted in the scheme. Borges is set to be sentenced in a Cincinnati federal court on Friday. The US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Ohio in a March news release did not explicitly identify the nuclear energy company involved in the scheme but noted that utility company FirstEnergy Corp. previously agreed to pay a $230 million penalty for “conspiring to bribe public officials and others” as part of a deferred prosecution settlement. Following Householder’s sentencing, FirstEnergy Corp. told CNN in an email that the company has “accepted responsibility for its actions related to House Bill 6 and has taken significant steps to put past issues behind us. Today we are a different, stronger company with a sound strategy and focused on a bright future.” The scheme centered on House Bill 6, a $1 billion dollar bailout that saved two nuclear plants operated by FirstEnergy Corp. In March 2017, FirstEnergy started making quarterly $250,000 payments to Householder’s tax-exempt social welfare account named Generation Now, US attorneys in Ohio’s southern district had said. Householder’s team then used that money to support HB 6’s passage and stop a ballot effort to overturn the law, the implementation of which has since been blocked. Millions of those dollars went to Householder’s bid for speaker, to other state House candidates likely to support him and to his team’s own pockets. Householder, federal prosecutors said, spent over $500,000 of those funds to “pay off his credit card balances, repair his Florida home and settle a business lawsuit.” Borges used about $366,000 for his own benefit and used another $15,000 to bribe an Ohio Republican operative for information on the number of signatures collected on the ballot referendum opposing HB 6, according to the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Ohio. Jeffrey Longstreth, Householder’s longtime campaign and political strategist, and Juan Cespedes, a lobbyist, previously pleaded guilty to their roles in the racketeering conspiracy. ",REAL
11,Biden has begun using CPAP machine for sleep apnea,"President Joe Biden has recently begun using a CPAP machine to treat sleep apnea, the White House says, after indentations from straps were seen on both sides of his face Wednesday morning. “Since 2008, the president has disclosed his history with sleep apnea in thorough medical reports. He used a CPAP machine last night, which is common for people with that history,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said. An official familiar with the matter said Biden began using the device in recent weeks to improve sleep quality. Marks could also be seen on the side of Biden’s face during a Monday event at the White House meant to promote an expansion of high-speed internet. Biden, who, at 80, is the nation’s oldest president, has had a history of sleep apnea in the past. Medical records released in 2008 indicated Biden had a recurring issue with sleep apnea. A health record released by Biden’s doctor in 2019 said sleep apnea “has been considered, but his symptoms have improved significantly after his sinus and nasal passage surgeries.” Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. About 30 million people in the United States have sleep apnea, according to the American Medical Association. A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine “uses mild air pressure to keep breathing airways open while you sleep,” according to the National Institutes of Health A readout of Biden’s last physical, conducted earlier this year, did not mention sleep apnea as a condition the president suffers from. Biden’s physicals have all indicated he is fit to serve as president. During Biden’s 2021 physical, the White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor singled out two areas of “observation”: an “increasing frequency and severity of ‘throat clearing’ and coughing during speaking engagements” and the president’s stiffer gait.

This could be the last Election Day you can call America a democracy with a straight face.” At press time, spending on 2022 federal and state races was expected to reach a midterm record of $16.7 billion.",FAKE
52,"At least 100,000 could have had data exposed after US health department was hit by global cyberattack","At least 100,000 people could have had their data compromised by a hack of contractors at the Department of Health and Human Services, a department official said Thursday, making it the latest US government agency to be caught up in a sweeping cyberattack connected to Russian cybercriminals. HHS notified Congress of the breach on Tuesday and will update lawmakers as the investigation continues, the official said. Agencies are required to notify Congress of a data breach that involves the compromise of personal information of 100,000 or more people. “While no HHS systems or networks were compromised, attackers gained access to data by exploiting the vulnerability in the MOVEit Transfer software of third-party vendors,” the official told CNN. MOVEit is the popular file-transfer software that suspected Russian cybercriminals have exploited in recent weeks to compromise scores of companies, schools and government agencies in the US and abroad. US firm Progress Software, which makes MOVEit, issued a security update for the software but the hackers had a few days’ head start in getting into systems. CNN first reported that several US agencies were affected by the MOVEit vulnerability, a list that includes the Department of Energy, Office of Personnel Management and US Department of Agriculture. Bloomberg News first reported that HHS was affected. Federal officials have blamed the hacking campaign exploiting the software on a Russian-speaking group known as CLOP. The hackers are generally stealing data from victims rather than encrypting their computers with ransomware and using the stolen data to make extortion demands. CLOP’s impact on federal agencies has been limited, officials say, but elsewhere millions of Americans have had their personal data accessed. Motor vehicle departments in Louisiana and Oregon, and California’s public pension fund have all had data stolen. Big-name victims or targets of the hack have continued to emerge. A spokesperson for Siemens Energy told CNN on Tuesday that the company was “among the targets” of the hack, but that “no critical data has been compromised and our operations have not been affected.” The University of California Los Angeles had its MOVEit platform hacked on May 28, a university spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday. “This is not a ransomware incident,” the spokesperson said. “There is no evidence of any impact to any other campus systems.” The hackers have been known to demand tens of millions of dollars in ransom in previous campaigns. But they are publishing a lot of the data stolen through the MOVEit hacks on their dark-web extortion site – a sign that some efforts to extract ransoms have failed. Some victims have paid the hackers, Charles Carmakal – an executive at Mandiant Consulting, a Google-owned firm hired by some victims to respond to the hacking – previously told CNN. It’s unclear how many of the victims have paid off the hackers or how much they have paid. Carmakal and others have declined to comment on that. But even a handful of victims with high payouts can be profitable and fuel future hacks. “We have many active forensic investigations involving this vulnerability involving data theft and extortion with unusually high ransom demands,” Shane Sims, a former supervisory special agent at the FBI who is now CEO of cybersecurity firm Kivu Consulting, told CNN. “Victims span the US and UK, and include the financial, industrial, legal, health care and technology sectors.” ",REAL
22,Here’s what’s left for the Supreme Court’s final week of the term,"Editor’s Note: A previous version of this story ran in early June. All eyes are on the Supreme Court for its final days of the term, as the justices will release cases on issues such as affirmative action, student loan payments and LGBTQ rights. Of the seven cases remaining, several that most capture the public’s attention are likely to lead to fiery opinions and dissents read from the bench. Alito in the hot seat over trips to Alaska and Rome he accepted from groups and individuals who lobby the Supreme Court In addition, they will come down as the court finds itself in the center of a spotlight usually reserved for members of the political branches due to allegations that the justices are not transparent enough when it comes to their ethics disclosures, most recently with Justice Samuel Alito last week. Here are some of the remaining cases to be decided: The court is considering whether colleges and universities can continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions, a decision that could overturn long standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students. At issue are programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina that the schools say help them to achieve diversity on campus. During oral arguments, the right side of the bench appeared ready to rule against the schools. Such an opinion would deliver a long-sought victory for opponents of affirmative action in higher education who have argued for decades that taking race into consideration – even in a limited manner – thwarts the goal of achieving a color-blind society. At the center of another case is a graphic designer, Lorie Smith, who seeks to expand her business and create custom websites to celebrate weddings – but does not want to work with gay couples out of religious objections to same-sex marriage. New documents show how Sandra Day O'Connor helped George W. Bush win the 2000 election Smith has not yet moved forward with her new business venture because of Colorado’s public accommodations law. Under the law, a business may not refuse to serve individuals because of their sexual orientation. Smith, whose company is called 303 Creative LLC, said that she is willing to work with all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, but she draws the line at creating websites that celebrate same-sex marriage because expressing such a message would be inconsistent with her beliefs. The state and supporters of LGBTQ rights say that Smith is simply seeking a license to discriminate. The conservatives on the court were sympathetic at oral arguments to those put forward by Smith’s lawyer. They viewed the case through the lens of free speech and suggested that an artist or someone creating a customized product could not be forced by the government to express a message that violates her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court is also considering two challenges to President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, an initiative aimed at providing targeted debt relief to millions of student-loan borrowers that has so far been stalled by legal challenges. Republican-led states and conservatives challenging the program say it amounts to an unlawful attempt to erase an estimated $430 billion of federal student loan debt under the guise of the pandemic. John Roberts upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act. What will he do next on race? At the heart of the case is the Department of Education’s authority to forgive the loans. Several of the conservative justices have signaled in recent years that agencies – with no direct accountability to the public – have become too powerful, upsetting the separation of powers. They have moved to cut back on the so-called administrative state. In court, Chief Justice John Roberts as well as some other conservatives seemed deeply skeptical of the Biden administration’s plan. A former mail carrier, an evangelical Christian, seeks to sue the US Postal Service because it failed to accommodate his request not to work on Sundays. A lower court had ruled against the worker, Gerald Groff, holding that his request would cause an “undue burden” on the USPS and lead to low morale at the workplace when other employees had to pick up his shifts. There appeared to be consensus, after almost two hours of oral arguments, that the appeals court had been too quick to rule against Groff. Moore v. Harper captured the nation’s attention because Republican lawmakers in North Carolina are asking the justices to adopt a long dormant legal theory and hold that state courts and other state entities have a limited role in reviewing election rules established by state legislatures when it comes to federal elections. The doctrine – called the Independent State Legislature theory – was pushed by conservatives and supporters of Donald Trump after the 2020 presidential election. Tuesday, a 6-3 court rejected it. How the 'independent state legislature' theory, now rejected by SCOTUS, fueled chaos in 2020 and could influence 2024 “State courts retain the authority to apply state constitutional restraints when legislatures act under the power conferred upon them by the Elections Clause,” Roberts wrote. As a result, there is now Supreme Court precedent rejecting some of the more maximalist but unsettled theories that have been championed by John Eastman and other GOP lawyers. But the somewhat limited ruling will leave plenty of avenues for future election-related challenges, regarding how districts are drawn, the deadlines for mail-in ballots and other key questions.

53,How the White House prepared for the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling,"The White House has been preparing for months for a potential Supreme Court ruling gutting affirmative action, even as President Joe Biden expressed optimism late last year that the court would uphold consideration of race in college admissions. Biden on Thursday directed the Department of Education to develop a list of best admissions practices to help colleges and universities maintain their commitment to diversity despite the ruling. Biden administration officials are working to finalize additional actions. “They should not abandon their commitment to ensure student bodies of diverse backgrounds and experience that reflect all of America,” Biden said of universities on Thursday, reacting to the ruling. In recent months, White House officials met with a slew of civil rights groups, universities and legal organizations to prepare for Thursday’s ruling, gathering information on how the administration could best handle the fallout and encourage colleges and universities not to abandon their efforts to admit diverse classes. Officials from the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of Public Engagement and the White House Counsel’s office worked with the Department of Justice and Department of Education to develop contingency plans and potential executive actions, White House officials said. Within the next 45 days, the Department of Education and Department of Justice will provide colleges and universities with resources to determine what admissions practices are and are not lawful. And as it drafts a report on admissions strategies for increasing diversity without affirmative action, the Department of Education will also convene a summit on educational opportunity that will include student leaders, researchers and university administrators. But officials have been clear that no step Biden could take would reverse the court’s ruling and the focus on providing non-binding guidance to universities reflects the limits of the president’s power on this issue. Still, officials inside the administration have been exploring what options exist. Those preparations took on more urgency over the last month as Biden met several times with his team to prepare for the Supreme Court’s ruling and develop a plan that would encourage higher education institutions to continue to work to build diverse classes and consider systemic barriers and inequities that applicants have faced. Biden has now directed his team to finalize those plans in light of the ruling, the officials said. During remarks from the White House on Thursday, Biden offered a glimpse of forthcoming guidance for colleges and universities, encouraging them to take into account financial means, geography and adversity an applicant has faced as they decide which students to accept. He also said colleges should factor “grit” and “determination” into admissions decisions. “We cannot let this decision be the last word,” Biden said. “While the court can render an opinion, it cannot change what America stands for.” In the decision, the Supreme Court ruled colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission, a landmark ruling overturning long-standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students in higher education. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying the Harvard and University of North Carolina admissions programs violated the Equal Protection Clause because they failed to offer “measurable” objectives to justify the use of race. He said the programs involve racial stereotyping and had no specific end point. Speaking from the White House, Biden called the decision a “severe disappointment” and said the court “walked away from decades of precedent” in its decision. He also told CNN, “This is not a normal court.” He later clarified his comments about the high court, saying the bench has “done more to unravel basic rights and basic decisions than any court in recent history.” “Take a look at how it’s, how it’s ruled on a number of issues that are – have been precedent for 50, 60 years sometimes,” Biden told MSNBC, citing the affirmative action ruling and last year’s move to overturn federal abortion protections. “And that’s what I meant by not normal.” Biden added that while he does think the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could cause harm to the nation, he doesn’t support expanding the court. “I think if we start the process of trying to expand the court, we’re going to politicize it maybe forever in a way that is not healthy,” he said. Months earlier, during a November news conference, Biden rejected the conventional wisdom that the court’s conservative majority was likely going to end race-based affirmative action. “I’m not prepared to believe that the Supreme Court is going to overrule the pre- – the existing decision. That’s far from certain,” Biden said. “I don’t believe that.” Biden now faces the prospect of a back-to-back setbacks as the Supreme Court is expected to rule Friday on the constitutionality of Biden’s program to forgive up to $20,000 of student loan debt for certain borrowers. The administration is also working to finalize contingency plans should that program be overturned. ",REAL

In the closing days of the quarter, the campaign is ramping up its push for grassroots donors, including enlisting former President Barack Obama to tape a video with Biden to help drive small-dollar donations, CNN has learned, along with hosting a slew of down-to-the-wire, high-dollar fundraisers. Biden’s campaign is highly attuned to how closely their early fundraising numbers will be examined for signs of the campaign’s operational strength and enthusiasm. Aides have tightly guarded the state of Biden’s campaign haul, refraining from publicly laying out a fundraising target for the second quarter or providing an early read on how much they raised in the opening days of the president’s reelection bid. Campaign advisers insist they’ll have the money to run a successful campaign. Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of Biden’s campaign, told CNN in an interview Wednesday that he’s growing more confident about their ability to exceed the $1 billion Biden raised in 2020. “There’s no question whatsoever that he will have all of the resources to run a highly competitive campaign at or above the level of four years ago,” Katzenberg said. “The enthusiasm, the support, the loyalty is at a 10.” Yet even Biden’s supporters acknowledge that the headwinds he faces in his overall campaign – including dampened enthusiasm and concern over his age – will influence his effort to raise as much as $2 billion for his reelection effort. Some donors have expressed anxiety over a slow start to the money race. “Not a lot of people are engaging right now. They’re like, ‘We’re gonna give. We’re gonna support him,’ but people aren’t as engaged in the 2024 operation right now,” one Biden campaign bundler told CNN. Katzenberg, who will be on hand at fundraisers in Chicago and New York this week, argued Biden isn’t facing the same time crunch to raise money compared to his 2020 run when he faced a competitive Democratic primary. “He’s not on the same path that he was four years ago. There are no primaries. The urgency and the timeline is simply not the same,” he said. “Our fundraising efforts are actually being very strategic and thoughtful about when you can activate people. And you want to activate them at the point when they are ready to actually give, and that is always around very specific moments and around urgency.” Biden’s campaign has yet to name a national finance director, a role tasked with overseeing the overall fundraising effort, prompting frustration among some donors who wanted to see a more formal structure from the outset. The campaign’s fundraising apparatus has largely been driven by the Democratic National Committee in the opening months of the campaign. When the president announced his reelection campaign in April, the campaign declined to provide figures for first-day or first week fundraising – as some candidates, including Biden in 2019, do when jumping into the race to demonstrate (and generate) excitement. One person familiar with the matter said the Biden campaign’s fundraising after the video announcement was “nothing special.” A separate source familiar with the matter said the reelection campaign’s fundraising has been stable since launch date and in line with the Biden team’s projections. “The campaign will share its fundraising numbers when we submit our FEC filing next month,” said Kevin Muñoz, a Biden campaign spokesperson. “We are encouraged by the strong response we are seeing from donors and our grassroots supporters, including a significant number of new donors since 2020 that support the President’s agenda for restoring democracy, freedom, and growing the economy by growing the middle class.” “While MAGA Republicans duke it out over extreme, divisive, and unpopular policies in their primary, we are ensuring that we have the resources needed to run an aggressive, winning campaign,” Munoz added. The Biden campaign declined to share its own fundraising target for this quarter, but campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez told CNN in an interview earlier this month she believes the campaign will show “strong momentum and energy.” “Folks are gonna want to try to poke holes at anything that they can, but I think that, you know, we’ll continue to show just strong momentum and energy,” Chavez Rodriguez said. Biden’s second quarter fundraising haul will likely be compared to that of his recent predecessors. When he announced his reelection in 2011, Obama burst out of the gate with a hefty second quarter fundraising haul of $86 million for the reelect and DNC, a record-setting figure for that time. Obama announced his reelection bid in the same fundraising quarter as Biden but had a three week lead on Biden’s entry into the 2024 race. Biden, never a prolific fundraiser, raised $21.5 million in his first quarter in the 2020 campaign, a figure that was surpassed by newcomer South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. How much money Biden and his team can raise in these early stages of the campaign could dictate how his campaign apparatus ultimately looks. So far, Biden’s team had made only a few hires and has relied in large part on the DNC, including for office space as they search for a headquarters building in Wilmington, Delaware. DNC fundraising officials organized a summit for top donors and supporters in the days after the launch, an effort to reengage some of the highest contributors from his 2020 bid. One tool the campaign hopes to leverage early on in their efforts is a joint fundraising agreement between the campaign, DNC and state Democratic parties, consolidating efforts to raise money early in the race and allow individual donors to contribute up to $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund. The president has spent the past two weeks crisscrossing the country for campaign cash. He raised roughly $5 million in one day of events with California Gov. Gavin Newsom during a two-day swing through California’s Bay Area last week, a source familiar with the events said. As the end of quarter approaches, the president is headlining five fundraisers in the span of three days, tapping into high-dollar donors in Chevy Chase, Maryland, New York City and Chicago, where the billionaire Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is hosting an event. First lady Dr. Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have also hit the fundraising circuit as well. Harris brought in $1.25 million for the Biden Victory Fund at the LGBTQ Leadership Council Gala in New York City earlier this week, a source familiar with the fundraiser said. The campaign also is leaning on its top surrogates this week to mobilize grassroots donors, including the Obama-Biden fundraising video rolling out on social media on Thursday. A campaign official argued the Obama-Biden duo is “an effective pairing” to push for small-dollar donors and represented “some of our best performing content from 2020.” Obama and Biden had lunch together at the White House on Tuesday. “He is throwing a marker down and saying, ‘Do not mistake, I am 100% in on supporting Joe Biden’s presidency,’” Katzenberg said of the Obama push. “As invaluable as his time is on the fundraising here, his endorsement, enthusiasm and continued support, friendship, loyalty. That’s what this about.” Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the chair of the campaign’s National Advisory Board and a prolific fundraiser herself, is hosting a call with other advisory board members Thursday to encourage them to tap into their donor networks in the closing days of the quarter, a campaign official said. And advisory board members including Sens. Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Murphy, and Raphael Warnock as well as New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a handful of members of Congress – Reps. Chrissy Houlihan, Sara Jacobs, and Lauren Underwood — are also expected to assist via e-mails, texts, and online fundraising. The campaign is hoping to galvanize online donations after Biden raised $700 million online during the 2020 cycle. White House digital strategy director Rob Flaherty, who ran the 2020 campaign’s digital operation, is expected to join the campaign this summer with an eye in part towards boosting online fundraising. Campaign advisers say they’ve seen positive signs about in the number of new donors drawn to the campaign, with one strategist saying, “The donor base right out of the box is expanded.” The campaign has sought to use moments like former President Donald Trump’s CNN Town Hall and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ Twitter launch snafu to expand their donor network, though the official declined to say specifically how much was raised as part of those efforts. Along with about a dozen fundraiser events headlined by the president, Chavez Rodriguez, her deputy, Quentin Fulks, and Democratic National Committee Executive Director Sam Cornale spent part of this month traveling the country to meet with top donors, local Democratic officials and other supporters in an effort to stir up enthusiasm and build fundraising momentum. Still, among the donor class, there is a certain malaise – a combination of fundraising fatigue, the lack of a specific Republican opponent as a motivator and a general lack of enthusiasm for Biden’s candidacy. Some Biden allies predict the president will have little trouble fundraising if Trump emerges as the Republican nominee, believing the former president is a strong motivator for donors and voters alike. But that message and the sentiment behind it belie an overall weariness among those being asked to dig deeper into their pockets. “There was fatigue during the midterms because you had this battle to save the country in 2020. People feel like the fundraising has just never stopped,” said one Democratic fundraiser, adding that any usual “cooling-off period” never arrived. “It’s just constant. And every quarter is the most important quarter,” the fundraiser said. Uncertainty in the Republican primary field could also hold back fundraising at this stage in the election, with nearly two months before candidates face off in the first GOP debate and more than six months before primary voters cast their first ballots. “Ultimately, the campaign is relying on one big thing above all else: They’re relying on Trump or DeSantis or someone who’s just so unpalatable being the nominee. That’ll drive everything,” the fundraiser predicted. John Morgan, one of a handful of donors to attend last week’s White House state dinner for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, told CNN he’s looking to hold a fundraiser for Biden in the fall. “The money is going to pour in – and if Trump is the nominee, it will pour in by double because Republicans will be writing checks too,” Morgan predicted. “Everybody was panicked last time but then he got the nomination, and he raised a billion dollars, and if Trump is the nominee, he might raise two billion,” Morgan said. The average minimum price to attend one of Biden’s first dozen fundraising events, a Democratic fundraiser said, is approximately $25,000 per person, with the average event raising between $1.5 to $2 million. Biden has used these events to test drive and sharpen a 2024 message, seeking to reframe concerns about his age. “It’s a legitimate thing to raise the question of age,” Biden told donors at a May fundraiser at the Manhattan apartment of former Blackstone executive Tony James. “I hope what I’ve been able to bring to this job, and will continue to bring, is a little bit of wisdom.” Biden has also worked to cater his message to donors who want face time with their candidate. “People want his time, which is much more difficult this time around,” compared to when he was a candidate in 2020, one bundler said. Ahead of one of this week’s fundraising events, an expected attendee told CNN he had to warn his colleagues who are attending their first Biden fundraiser to manage expectations: “It’s gonna be cool no matter what. You get to shake hands with the president and take a photo with him. We’re all excited for that. But, you know, he is not Barack Obama. He’s not Bill Clinton. He’s not George W. Bush,” the attendee said. ",REAL
32,Democrats Vow To Make Better Effort To Reach Out To Hollywood Elite,"LOS ANGELES—Pledging to never again lose focus on their most important constituents, the Democratic National Committee reportedly vowed Tuesday to make a better effort to reach out to the Hollywood elite. “What these elections have toldus loud and clear is that Democrats must get back to our roots as the party of Hollywood’s most influential celebrities,” said DNC chairman Jaime Harrison, stressing that Democratic candidates would pound the pavement in Beverly Hills, hand out flyers outside of Nobu Hollywood, and rub elbows with A-listers at Chateau Marmont fundraisers for as long as necessary to show that they hadn’t fallen out of touch with actors, directors, and producers. “Personally, I’ve spent hours listening to the concerns of people like Adam McKay to assure him that this party will never forget our country’s richest and most powerful creatives. We’ve let our attention stray for too long. That’s not who the Democratic Party is, that’s not who we ever have been. Simply put, we need to do better.” Harrison went on to emphasize that their renewed commitment to West Coast celebrities did not mean they would ever turn their back on New York City’s cosmopolitan elite.",FAKE
38,Kamala Harris Loses Benefits After Hours Get Cut At Work,"WASHINGTON—Left reeling after discovering she no longer qualified for healthcare coverage through her White House job, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly lost her benefits Wednesday after her hours got cut at work. “Are you kidding me? Those assholes didn’t even warn me first,” said Harris, who was furious after checking the paper schedule posted outside the chief of staff’s office and learning she had only been assigned three 8-hour shifts as vice president for the coming week. “This is such bullshit. It’s not like I like working here, but I need this fucking job! And it’s not like I can just go get a second job, because the schedule changes every week. Those complete dicks! They’re trying to push me out! I should have known this was going to happen when they refused to offer me a 401(k) even though all my aides have one.”  Harris added that the worst part was that she was scheduled to be vice president on Saturday night.",FAKE
19,Hakeem Jeffries is staging a takeover of the New York Democrats. His hope to become Speaker may depend on it.,"Hakeem Jeffries’ path to winning the majority and becoming speaker runs through his backyard in New York, and he is methodically staging a takeover of Democratic House campaigns in the state to make it happen. Jeffries, a New York Democrat, is installing his own loyalists in key positions as he effectively takes over much of the state party operations that would usually be controlled by Gov. Kathy Hochul. CNN’s conversations with two dozen elected officials and operatives involved detail the extent that the House minority leader is already digging in, a year and a half ahead of the 2024 elections: he’s hosting regular political brainstorming dinners in Washington with the Democrats in the state’s House delegation, deputizing several to oversee political operations down to the county level. He’s making his case personally to some of the biggest Democratic donors in the country. He’s personally traveling to swing congressional districts all around the state. New Yorkers always think of themselves as the center of the universe. In the battle for control of the House next year, they sort of will be: Democrats need five seats to get the majority in the US House in 2024, and there are currently six Republican freshmen who won last year in Democratic-leaning districts of New York. “New York,” Jeffries told CNN in an interview in his Capitol office, “will play an important and outsized role in the outcome of the 2024 House elections. Period. Full stop.” Asked about efforts already underway to sidestep the tradition of Democratic leaders staying out of primaries, Jeffries suppressed a smirk. Top ally Rep. Greg Meeks wasn’t so coy. “We will be looking at and talking to all possible candidates and trying to talk to folks to say, ‘Who is more likely to beat the extreme Republican that they will be running against?’” said Meeks, who also serves as the Queens County Democratic chairman. Whether Jeffries can wrangle New York’s infamously infighting parochial party players will be the biggest test of his own political and fundraising abilities. He only recently took over for former Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the leader of House Democrats. But he’s already scored the kind of win that President Joe Biden and Democrats nationally are hoping for. Leaders of powerful groups on the left will prioritize campaigning on traditional Democratic mainstream issues of protecting Social Security and Medicare, rather than issues like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. “If you’re a member of Congress from New York, you have a pretty healthy ego and a pretty strong survival instinct, so you tend to be more entrepreneurial and more individualistic,” said Steve Israel, a former congressman from Long Island and two-time chair of the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “It seems that there’s a greater understanding that cooperation is actually a good political strategy, and competition is not.” Many of the people involved in the efforts say they worry crime will surge back as an issue, allowing Republicans to capitalize in New York races as they did in 2022, or that the dreams of unity will not be able to hold among New York Democrats who for years have been more about finger-pointing and parochialism. But most New York Democrats expect to capitalize on higher base turnout expected in a presidential election year. They think a measure on the ballot to codify abortion and other rights will also drive turnout among the base. And they are holding out hope for a court decision that would scrap the redistricting map forced by Republican-backed litigation last year, enabling them to draw more favorable districts for their candidates to run in. There is also the pride in potentially putting the gavel not just in the hands of a New Yorker for the first time in 150 years (the last one was only speaker for a day), but one who would make history as the first Black speaker. Several top officials also pointed out that if Jeffries is running the House while fellow Brooklynite Chuck Schumer is majority leader in the Senate, it will mean more attention and federal money coming back home. Two weeks ago, Jeffries had 300 donors and activists on a Zoom call, officially launching what they’re calling the Battleground Coordinated Campaign. Two nights later, at the Astor Place apartment of Alex Soros—who this month took over political spending for his father, George—pitching some of the city’s biggest Democratic donors to spend their money locally with the House Majority super PAC. The PAC banked $4 million for a centralized hub of opposition research and attack ads in New York that is already at work, while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has started advertising in the state earlier than ever before and created fundraising efforts to bank money for whichever candidates emerge from primaries. “When literally the stakes are people threatening our entire democracy,” said Rep. Pat Ryan, the upstate Democrat who already hosted Jeffries for several events in his frontline district the day after they were together at the fundraiser at Soros’s apartment, “that has unified and rallied everyone.” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who will be the only statewide Democratic candidate on the ticket next year, has already transferred $300,000 to the state party along with having campaign aides meet with operatives fresh off races in places like Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia. “We have,” she said on the Battleground Coordinated Campaign launch Zoom call, “a unique opportunity to change the course of the country ourselves.” House races in New York went about as badly for Democrats as they could have last year. From Pelosi on down, many blame Hochul for not responding quickly enough to Republican attacks that their party was soft on crime, and for not running a strong enough re-election campaign of her own to help provide coattails for the candidates lower down on the ticket. Hochul pushed back on those complaints, while also making a point of highlighting the changes she backed to the bail reform laws which provided the opening for last year’s Republican narrative about the rise in crime. “The truth was no barrier to anything [Republicans] did,” Hochul told CNN in an interview. “But we know it’s coming.” Calling this “unprecedented coordination,” Hochul said she’s been raising money for the state party and pushing revamps on both communications and operational strategies, attributing the slow start to the fact that she took over less than two years ago following Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation. She was almost immediately plunged right into a re-election campaign. She says this coming election cycle is “a chance to assert my influence on the New York State Democratic Party.” “I think about it all day long,” said Hochul. She called flipping the House seats held by Republicans “my number one political priority.” But the House delegation is already stepping in. Rep. Grace Meng, who served with Jeffries in the state assembly and is now another main lieutenant in the delegation, has already conducted a review of what was felt to be fumbling Black, Latino and Asian outreach in the 2022 elections. She co-wrote a memo to the state party advising a revamp of operations, and is digging deep into Tuesday’s city council primaries and the county-level races this fall that they’re viewing as practice for next year. Meng, along with fellow Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ryan and Brian Higgins also collaborated on a memo to the state party of ideas that they want to see progress on. High on that list was a big push on college campus outreach, which they feel has been largely ignored to date. Cautious in every word he says publicly himself, Jeffries is also looking to get candidates and activists unified on talking points about crime and immigration. Even a year and a half out from election day, many of the leaders involved were using almost exactly Jeffries’ phrasing in multiple separate interviews with CNN. They say New York Republicans are extremists who masquerade as moderates back home despite going along with the GOP majority on nearly every vote. “We will not allow them to fool the American people, and most importantly, New Yorkers, in November of 2024,” Jeffries told CNN. Meanwhile, rumors that Adams might support a separate political group to further his own interests as mayor have dissipated. A person familiar with his thinking expects Adams to help with raising money and other behind-the-scenes moves. Still, not everyone is ready to commit. Howard Wolfson, top political advisor to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, has met several times with House Majority PAC operatives. But Bloomberg isn’t ready to make any of the multi-million dollar commitments that they and others are counting on. A lot depends where the crime rates are, Wolfson said, and how Jeffries and others do on recruiting strong candidates. But, he added, “there is definitely a lot of opportunity here if we play our cards right.” Already on board, though, are many of the same activists who have clashed with Jeffries in the past, accusing him of being too moderate or a corporatist sellout. Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the liberal and union coalition Working Families Party, called the collaboration “just a recognition of the political conditions that we’re in.” Eventually he and other left-wing activists in New York will come back to their usual issues, Mitchell said, but “I can’t even engage that conversation in terms of governing if a bunch of extremists are in power. So it’s an order of operations question for me.” Ed Cox, the GOP state chair, told CNN that he expects a “tough fight” to hold onto the House seats given the expected turnout in a presidential election year. But he promised to raise enough money to keep even with the Democrats for candidates he said had proven strong in their districts. “Competition’s good,” Cox said. “We’re not scared of competition.” Cox, who two weeks ago attended the speech Trump gave at his New Jersey golf course after his federal indictment from retaining classified material, ducked answering whether the Republican incumbents in New York would benefit or suffer if the former president is at the top of the ticket again as the Republican nominee. But already the Republicans who will be on the ballot are largely veering away from talking like the former president who was famous for stamping his name all over New York before he stamped in on the Republican Party. Chris Russell, a senior political adviser to Rep. Mike Lawler, pointed to Biden’s comments during a trip to the district in May that the congressman is “the kind of Republican I was used to dealing with.” Rep. Marc Molinaro, who represents another upstate district at the top of Democrats’ list, told CNN he was disappointed but not surprised to hear Jeffries’ attack. “He has a responsibility to say the things that he said,” Molinaro said. “I suggest that most people I represent and most people he represents want us to work together to try to get solutions to problems that face us. That’s what we’re focused on right now.” One incumbent that Republicans are not planning to protect: Rep. George Santos, who is currently facing charges of fraud and misuse of public funds and who has been disavowed by his colleagues and local Republican officials. But Cox said Republicans are still going to fight for his seat, and dismissed the chances that ties to the congressman would weigh other Republicans down. “This is going to be a totally new race with new candidates. It depends who they are. It’s a district that we won, and we can win it again,” Cox said. “Santos will be left in the dust. Forgotten.” ",REAL
6,Federal judge blocks part of Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors,"A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily halted the enforcement of part of Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors in the state. Senate Bill 1, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee in March and set to take effect July 1, prohibited health care providers “from performing on a minor or administering to a minor a medical procedure if the performance or administration of the procedure is for the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex.” It specifies that minors who receive care cannot be held liable, but lawsuits could be brought against a minor’s parents “if the parent of the minor consented to the conduct that constituted the violation on behalf of the minor.” In Wednesday’s ruling, US District Judge Eli Richardson issued a preliminary injunction blocking the state’s enforcement of a ban on such gender-affirming treatments as hormone therapies and puberty blockers. The ruling, however, allowed Tennessee to ban gender transition surgical procedures. “The Court realizes that today’s decision will likely stoke the already controversial fire regarding the rights of transgender individuals in American society on the one hand, and the countervailing power of states to control certain activities within their borders and to use that power to protect minors,” Richardson said in his ruling. “If Tennessee wishes to regulate access to certain medical procedures, it must do so in a manner that does not infringe on the rights conferred by the United States Constitution, which is of course supreme to all other laws of the land,” the judge added. “With regard to SB1, Tennessee has likely failed to do just this.” The American Civil Liberties Union celebrated Wednesday’s ruling. Joshua Block, senior staff attorney for ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Projects, called it a “critical victory for transgender youth, their families, and their medical providers across the state.” “Across the country, we’re seeing a clear and unanimous rejection of these laws as unconstitutional, openly discriminatory, and a danger to the very youth they claim to protect,” Block said. CNN reported earlier this month that more than a dozen states have targeted gender-affirming care, with some bans including the possibility of a felony charge. ",REAL
18,DOJ targets nationwide health care fraud scheme involving over $2.5 billion,"The Justice Department announced a sweeping enforcement effort Wednesday aimed at health care, telemedicine and illegal prescription schemes totaling of $2.5 billion in alleged fraud. The two-week national law enforcement effort resulted in both federal and state level charges against 78 defendants – 24 of whom are doctors, nurses, or other licensed medical professionals. Cases were brought 16 states including California, Florida, Georgia and New York. As part of the enforcement action officials issued 90 Medicare and Medicaid revocations and billing suspensions, and seized or restrained millions of dollars in cash, automobiles and real estate. “These enforcement actions, including against one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever prosecuted by the Justice Department, represent our intensified efforts to combat fraud and prosecute the individuals who profit from it,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday. “The Justice Department will find and bring to justice criminals who seek to defraud Americans and steal from taxpayer-funded programs.” Several of the schemes, according to the Justice Department, were aimed at vulnerable populations like the elderly, people with mental health issues, pregnant people, individuals with opioid addictions and patients at risk of contracting HIV. In one case, prosecutors allege that the leaders of a software company conspired to create a platform that allowed doctors and telemarketers to coordinate selling medical equipment in exchange for kickbacks. According to the indictment, the defendants created a massive telemarketing operation that targeted disabled and elderly patients with letters, calls and advertisements to sign up for unnecessary medical equipment or prescriptions. The software, according to the indictment, then generated fake Medicare order formers for doctors to sign so that it would appear as thought the equipment orders were real and necessary. The conspiracy, prosecutors say, resulted in $1.9 billion in fraudulent reimbursement claims submitted to Medicare and other government insurers. A second case in Washington state includes allegations that a licensed physician signed more than 2,800 fraudulent orders for orthotic braces, including for patients whose limbs had already been amputated. Prosecutors also went after individuals who allegedly bought back HIV medications from patients and then repacked those medications to be sold to pharmacies – sometimes containing the wrong medications or proper labels, broken pills or pebbles. In another case, a Wisconsin woman allegedly hosted community baby showers to coerce pregnant people into signing up for prenatal services through her company and then used those patients to submit millions of dollars in fraudulent claims.

Thanks to this law, we can guarantee that no engineer driving 20,000 tons of freight across this great nation will be able to access healthcare without having their pay docked.” Biden went on to express confidence that next year, bipartisan legislation would be passed to ensure rail workers were no longer allowed to eat or sleep between shifts.",FAKE
23,US military launches official investigation of disputed drone strike that reportedly killed civilian,"An official investigation has been launched by US Central Command into the May 3 drone strike in Syria that reportedly killed a civilian instead of the intended senior al-Qaeda target. A statement from CENTCOM on Wednesday said that the civilian casualty credibility assessment recently completed has become an official 15-6 investigation. CNN reported earlier this month that CENTCOM was preparing to launch the formal investigation. “The civilian casualty credibility assessment process has become an AR 15-6 investigation,” the CENTCOM statement on Wednesday said. “Maj. Gen. Matthew McFarlane, commander of [Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve], appointed a general officer as the investigating officer, effective June 23, 2023.” The investigation comes eight weeks after the drone strike which was targeting a senior al-Qaeda leader. Despite confidence from senior CENTCOM officials in the aftermath of the strike that they had killed an al-Qaeda leader, family members of the person reportedly killed in the strike said he was a farmer with no terrorism ties. The family identified the man killed as 56-year-old Loutfi Hassan Mesto, a father of 10. CENTCOM officials knew it would take time to identify the person killed in the strike. Nevertheless, the day of the operation, CENTCOM commander Gen. Erik Kurilla ordered a tweet be sent from the command’s official Twitter account announcing the strike. “At 11:42 am local Syrian time on 3 May, US Central Command Forces conducted a unilateral strike in Northwest Syria targeting a senior Al Qaeda leader,” the tweet said. “We will provide more information as operational details become available.” CENTCOM has not provided more details about the strike. The formal 15-6 investigation is the latest in a drawn-out timeline following the strike. It took two weeks for CENTCOM to begin the civilian casualty assessment, which started a week after The Washington Post presented information to CENTCOM about the strike potentially killing a civilian instead of the intended target. Asked in May about the strike, Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a news briefing that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has “complete confidence” in the department’s civilian harm mitigation efforts. “I think our record speaks for itself in terms of how seriously we take these,” he said. “Very few countries around the world do that. The secretary has complete confidence that we will continue to abide by the policies that we put into place.” ",REAL
49,Judge denies Trump motion to dismiss Carroll defamation lawsuit,"A federal judge denied Donald Trump’s motion to dismiss E. Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit, finding the former president’s legal arguments are “without merit.” Trump filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss Carroll’s original defamation lawsuit filed in 2019. He argued he was entitled to immunity because he was president at the time he made statements denying Carroll’s rape allegation and that his statements were not defamatory. Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Trump’s motion and his request to amend his answer to argue immunity as a defense in the case, noting that Trump already waived that as a possible defense and allowing it now would unfairly prejudice Carroll. “There is no basis to risk prolonging the resolution of this litigation further by permitting Mr. Trump to raise his absolute immunity defense now at the eleventh hour when he could have done so years ago,” the judge wrote. There are additional legal motions outstanding. The case is set to go to trial early next year. “Judge Kaplan’s denial of summary judgment confirms that once again, Donald Trump’s supposed defenses to E Jean Carroll’s defamation claims don’t work,” Robbie Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll, said in a statement. “Trump chose to waive presidential immunity and now he must live with the results of that decision.” Trump attorney Alina Habba said, “We disagree with the Court’s decision and will be taking the appropriate steps to preserve all viable defenses.” This case is separate from the 2022 battery and defamation lawsuit that went to trial earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages and found Trump sexually abused and defamed her. Trump this week filed a counter claim against Carroll alleging she defamed him when she appeared on CNN the day after the jury verdict and said, “Oh yes he did” rape her. This story has been updated with additional reaction. ",REAL
48,Supreme Court revives case brought by postal worker seeking religious accommodations,"The Supreme Court revived the case of a former mail carrier, an evangelical Christian, who said the United States Postal Service violated federal law by failing to reasonably accommodate his inability to work on Sundays. The court said unanimously that a lower court was too quick to deny the employee’s request for accommodation and should take another look at the impact the request would have on the Postal Service as a whole. “We think it is enough to say that an employer must show that the burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote, penning the court’s opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurrence joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. A lower court had ruled against the worker, Gerald Groff, holding that his request would cause an undue hardship on the Postal Service and lead to low morale at the workplace when other employees had to pick up his shifts. The new ruling, in clarifying previous precedent for religious accommodations, will likely make it harder for an employer to refuse to accommodate the religious beliefs of an employee under Title VII of the civil rights law. The Supreme Court left the door open that the Postal Service might still prevail in the case, and the justices said they were leaving it to the lower court to revisit the case under the clarified standard. “An employer who fails to provide an accommodation has a defense only if the hardship is ‘undue,’ and a hardship that is attributable to employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in general, or to the very notion of accommodating religious practice cannot be considered ‘undue,’” Alito wrote. The opinion concluded that “Title VII requires that an employer reasonably accommodate an employee’s practice of religion, not merely that it assess the reasonableness of a particular possible accommodation or accommodations.” “Faced with an accommodation request like Groff’s, it would not be enough for an employer to conclude that forcing other employees to work overtime would constitute an undue hardship,” the court’s opinion said. “Consideration of other options, such as voluntary shift swapping, would also be necessary.” Sotomayor’s concurrence highlighted a distinction in the court’s opinion, noting that the court had ruled that Title VII requires that an employer, in rejecting a requested accommodation, must show that the accommodation would impose “undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” Her concurrence focused on how a proposed accommodation could impose an undue hardship on a business’ employees. “Indeed, for many businesses, labor is more important to the conduct of the business than any other factor,” she wrote. Not all effects an accommodation places on employees will amount to such a hardship, Sotomayor said, but “if there is an undue hardship on ‘the conduct of the employer’s business’ … then such hardship is sufficient, even if it consists of hardship on employees.” Aaron Streett, Groff’s attorney, said Thursday, “This is an important victory for Americans of all faiths, who may now follow their religious consciences in the workplace. It is especially gratifying that the Court was unanimous in interpreting the Civil Rights Act according to its plain language, holding that employers must accommodate religious practices absent an ‘undue hardship’ on the ‘conduct of the business.’” The US Postal Service, however, expressed confidence that it would ultimately prevail in the next round of proceedings. “We agree with the Supreme Court’s clarification, which accepts the arguments we made before the Court, and which is fully consistent with the standard we apply when seeking to accommodate the sincerely held religious beliefs, observances, and practices of our employees,” USPS spokesperson Felicia Lott said in a statement. “For those reasons, and because we believe the lower court will conclude that providing the requested accommodation here would impose a substantial burden on the Postal Service, we are confident that the Postal Service will again prevail when the case is remanded.” Groff, who lives in Pennsylvania, served in 2012 as a rural carrier associate at the United States Postal Service, a position that provides coverage for absent career employees who have earned the ability to take off weekends. Rural carrier associates are told they need flexibility. In 2013, Groff’s life changed when the USPS contracted with Amazon to deliver packages on Sundays. Groff’s Christian religious beliefs bar him from working on Sundays. The post office contemplated some accommodations to Groff, such as offering to adjust his schedule so he could come to work after religious services or telling him he should see if other workers could pick up his shifts. At some point, the postmaster himself did the deliveries because it was difficult to find employees willing to work on Sunday. Finally, the USPS suggested Groff choose a different day to observe the Sabbath. The atmosphere with his co-workers was tense and Groff said he faced progressive discipline. In response, he filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is charged with enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against an employee because of religion. Groff ultimately left his job in 2019. In a resignation letter, he said he had been unable to find an “accommodating employment atmosphere with the USPS that would honor his religious beliefs.” Groff sued, arguing that the USPS violated Title VII. District Judge Jeffrey Schmehl, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, ruled against Groff, holding that that his request to not work on Sundays would cause an “undue hardship” for the USPS. The 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling in a 2-1 opinion. When the case was before the Supreme Court, Groff’s lawyer, Aaron Streett, told the justices that the USPS could have done more and was wrong to claim that “respecting Groff’s belief was too onerous.” He urged the justices to cut back or invalidate precedent and allow an accommodation that would allow the worker to “serve both his employer and his God.” “To me, it’s not just about going to church,” Groff said in a video posted on the website of his legal team at First Liberty. “It’s about obeying the Lord and putting the entire day aside to honor and glorify Him,” he added. The Biden administration had urged the high court to simply clarify the law to make clear that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee’s Sabbath observance by “operating shorthanded or regularly paying overtime to secure replacement workers.” The Becket Fund, a religious liberty legal advocacy organization that supported Groff in a friend-of-the-court brief, praised Thursday’s opinion. “Big corporations got away with firing employees for their religious practices for decades, thanks to a fundamental misreading of civil rights law,” Becket Fund president and CEO Mark Rienzi said in a statement. “That mistake by the Court long pushed faith out of daily life by giving employers free rein to give religious workers the boot for observing holy days and taking time to pray. Today’s ruling corrects decades of rulings against religious Americans.” This story has been updated with additional information. ",REAL
46,"Mike Pence earned millions through book deal, six-figure speeches, new filings show","Former Vice President Mike Pence collected a $1.4 million advance for his memoir, which recounted the events of January 6, 2021, and his refusal to buckle to Donald Trump’s demands to overturn the 2020 election results, new filings show. The advance from Simon & Schuster for “So Help Me God” is among the large sources of income described in a financial disclosure report released Thursday. Pence is now running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination against Trump and a slew of other Republicans. The filings also show that Pence has earned big sums on the speaking circuit, collecting a total of $3.4 million for 32 speeches between January 2022 and the end of April this year. Pence announced his candidacy for the White House in early June. The most lucrative engagement: A $550,000 honorarium for a February 2022 appearance at a world summit underwritten by the Universal Peace Federation in Seoul, South Korea. The group was established by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon – the Korean evangelist and businessman who founded the Unification Church – and his wife, Hak Ja Han. According to the online transcript of his Seoul speech, Pence called for the de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula and pledged American support for South Korea, Japan and “all of our allies for peace and security across the free world.” He also praised The Washington Times, a conservative newspaper established by Moon, as a “courageous voice for freedom in America.” Other six-figure engagements ranged from a March 2022 appearance before the American Fuel and Petroleum Manufacturers trade group to a March 2023 speech to the Iranian American Community of Northern California. He also reported payments for 10 speeches to colleges and universities. Those were described as paid for by the Young America’s Foundation, which works to popularize conservative ideas among young people. According to his filings, Pence is vice president of Hoosier Heartland LLC and reported more than $1.8 million in business income from that company, which is described as engaging in speaking, writing and consulting. The firm’s clients have not been disclosed. The former vice president reported earning $381,000 in salary from the company. ",REAL
25,President Biden denies he was present during alleged Hunter Biden 2017 text,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday emphatically denied that he was involved or present when his son Hunter Biden is alleged to have texted a Chinese business partner in 2017, claiming that he was sitting with his father. Asked whether he was involved in the business dealings or was sitting with Hunter when the message was sent, Biden told reporters Wednesday, “No. I wasn’t.” Asked again, Biden replied more forcefully, “No.” The White House has previously declined to say whether Biden was present during the alleged exchange. The questions referred to a portion of the testimony in which a IRS supervisor-turned-whistleblower told House lawmakers that Justice Department prosecutors denied requests to look into messages allegedly from Hunter Biden where he used his father as leverage to pressure a Chinese company into paying him. “I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled,” according to testimony the whistleblower gave to Congress, which quotes from texts that are allegedly from Hunter Biden to the CEO of a Chinese fund management company. The message continues: “Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand. And now means tonight.” The message goes onto say, “I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction. I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father.” The second, unnamed IRS whistleblower also testified to lawmakers about this alleged WhatsApp message, saying prosecutors questioned whether they could be sure Hunter Biden was telling the truth that his father was actually in the room in the messages. The unnamed whistleblower testified that they did not know whether the FBI investigated the message. Chris Clark, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said on Friday that the Justice Department had thoroughly investigated the case, including the time in which the message was sent. “The DOJ investigation covered a period which was a time of turmoil and addiction for my client. Any verifiable words or actions of my client, in the midst of a horrible addiction, are solely his own and have no connection to anyone in his family,” Clark said in a statement. It was announced last week that Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty next month to two tax misdemeanors and struck a deal with federal prosecutors to resolve a felony gun charge. ",REAL
57,"Impeachment push set to take center stage in House, bringing new chapter for GOP","House Republicans are preparing to let the push for potential impeachment proceedings dominate their agenda over the next few months, as Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces growing pressure from an increasingly restive right flank eager to take aim at President Joe Biden and his Cabinet. The increased focus on impeachment — with Biden’s attorney general and homeland security secretary the highest on the GOP’s list — underscores how Republicans are quickly shifting their focus to red-meat issues that could fire up their base, even as some in their conference are nervous about voter backlash over the more aggressive approach. Between July and September, Republicans are slated to hear high-profile testimony from a trio of Biden Cabinet officials who have been top impeachment targets on the right: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Attorney General Merrick Garland. Just this week, a new focus emerged for McCarthy when he announced that Republicans are prepared to open an impeachment inquiry into Garland if an IRS whistleblower’s claim about alleged meddling in the Hunter Biden case holds up, an idea that has been heavily promoted by the far-right bloc of his conference. McCarthy’s comments then set off fresh momentum. He appeared side by side with House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan on Fox News Wednesday night to reaffirm his position. And on Thursday, Jordan, along with House Oversight Chair James Comer and House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith requested transcribed interviews with Department of Justice, FBI and IRS officials involved in the Hunter Biden case, including US Attorney David Weiss, the Trump-appointed attorney who oversaw the criminal investigation. Garland has rejected claims that the Justice Department improperly interfered in the probe. The moves come amid pressure on House GOP leaders and committee chairmen to launch official impeachment proceedings – potentially on Biden himself. House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green said he is conducting a “five phase” investigation into Mayorkas over problems at the southern border that could culminate in an impeachment recommendation to the House Judiciary Committee, which Green expects to finish by this September. His committee is also expected to include a review of Biden’s handling of the border as part of that impeachment probe. “We’re looking at all the things that they’re failing to do,” Green told CNN. “There’s not going to be that much of a change other than we’ll dig into the actual actions of the president in conjunction with what’s happened.” With patience on the right wearing out, one hardline GOP member, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, tried to force a snap floor vote last week on impeaching Biden, though Republican leaders rebuffed the effort and referred the matter to relevant committees instead. “We’ve been investigating this failure at the southern border now for a little while … and now the House has asked us to add the president’s actions into this,” Green said. “And we’ll dig into that too.” Conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has introduced a slew of impeachment articles against Biden and various Cabinet members, has also signaled she intends to force floor votes on her resolutions, meaning the issue is sure to take center stage for the House GOP in the weeks and months ahead. “I’ve talked to everyone here until I’m blue in the face for a long time about impeachment,” Greene told CNN. It all represents a new chapter for the nascent House Republican majority – and particularly for McCarthy, who has up until this point been reluctant to lean into impeachment proceedings, instead insisting that his committee chairs focus on gathering evidence and holding hearings before going down that route. And he has instead tried to channel his conference’s focus on messaging bills like energy and immigration. Many in McCarthy’s conference are uncertain about the new focus. “Impeachment should be treated in the serious matter it deserves,” said Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a Nebraska swing district and said he would review the facts before deciding how to proceed with any impeachment proceedings. “We’ve lowered the bar over the last four years, and it’s not healthy.” After facing backlash from conservatives for cutting a debt limit deal with Biden and as the clock ticks toward the 2024 elections, McCarthy has started to warm up to the idea of impeaching a member of Biden’s Cabinet – whether it be Garland or Mayorkas or both, according to multiple sources familiar with this thinking. The move could win over some on his right flank. McCarthy has also faced pressure behind closed doors as members like Greene have met with him to personally make their case for why the House GOP should launch impeachment proceedings. And McCarthy will need every ounce of conservative support he can get as he heads into spending season, where he may be forced to ultimately compromise with Democrats once again and fall short of the demands from the far right. “I think what the House is going to do, we’re going to continue to investigate. We’re going to continue to follow this chain of evidence,” Rep. Byron Donalds, a member of the hardliner House Freedom Caucus, told CNN after the IRS whistleblower testimony was revealed. “I think the evidence is leading us to clear issues of obstruction of Justice at the Department of Justice. And with the White House.” Impeaching a Cabinet official has only happened once in US history when William Belknap, the secretary of war, was impeached by the House before being acquitted by the Senate in 1876. But some in the GOP view the idea of charging a Cabinet member with committing a high crime or misdemeanor as an easier sell than impeaching Biden himself. Yet McCarthy would still have some serious work to do in wrangling the votes for impeachment, with some moderate and vulnerable House Republicans still concerned about the optics of the politically contentious move, which would be dead on arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Some of those Republican holdouts serve on the House Judiciary Committee, whose panel would be responsible for launching any official impeachment proceedings. “I don’t know why we have members on Judiciary that can’t vote for impeachment,” Greene told CNN. In the meantime, committees are expected to plug away with their investigative work. The House Oversight panel intends to conduct transcribed interviews with witnesses in the investigations into Biden’s mishandling of classified material and potential Biden family influence peddling, an Oversight Committee aide told CNN, while Weiss faces a deadline of next week to hand over documents related to the Hunter Biden probe. And in addition to taking aim at Biden, some key Republicans are pushing the House to take up a symbolic effort to clear Trump’s name, in just another example of how Republicans are using their power to run defense for Trump. Last week, Greene and House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik introduced a pair of resolutions to expunge both of Trump’s impeachments – something McCarthy also said he supports. “It is past time to expunge Democrats’ sham smear against not only President Trump’s name, but against millions of patriots across the country,” Stefanik said in a statement.

21,Exonerated Central Park Five member Yusef Salaam poised to win New York City Council seat,"An exonerated member of the Central Park Five, Yusef Salaam, is poised to win a Democratic primary race for a New York City Council seat in Harlem. Salaam declared victory at a campaign event in Harlem Tuesday night, where he thanked the community for giving him a “second chance” after his exoneration and spoke about the adversity he once faced. “This campaign has been about those who have been counted out,” Salaam said. “This campaign has been about those who have been forgotten. This campaign has been about our Harlem community who has been pushed into the margins of life and made to believe that they were supposed to be there.” New York City uses a system known as ranked choice voting in primary and special elections for many local offices, where voters can rank up to five candidates in order of their preferences. A candidate who receives more than 50% of first-choice votes is declared the winner. If no candidate meets that mark, the candidate with the fewest votes gets eliminated and their ballots get redistributed to voters’ next choice. That process continues until there are only two candidates left and the candidate with the most votes wins. As of Wednesday morning, Salaam had received 50.1% of the vote. CNN has not yet projected a winner in the race, and mail ballots that were postmarked Tuesday can still be received until July 4, but even if Salaam finishes just under 50%, he’d still easily be the best-positioned candidate to win once votes start getting redistributed. The winner of the primary is almost certain to win the seat given the heavy Democratic tilt of the district. Salaam was one of five teenagers accused of raping a jogger and pressured into giving false confessions. They were exonerated in 2002 when DNA evidence linked another person to the crime. The teenagers sued New York City and the case was later settled. In the wake of the crime in 1989, former President Donald Trump took out full-page newspaper ads that read: “Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!” On Tuesday night, Salaam recalled to his supporters what it was like to see those ads at the time. “There were large ads bought in 1989, a whisper for the state to kill us,” Salaam said. “A whisper, in fact, into the darkest enclaves of society for them to do to us what they had done to Emmett Till.” Trump said in an interview with Larry King that his newspaper ads were not “pre-judging” the five teens, but rather advocating for their execution if they were to be found guilty and the victim died. Trump also said his ads did not apply to minors, but said minors convicted of crimes should be locked up for a long time in the prison system. The former president has never apologized for taking out the ads. ",REAL
50,"Biden’s Iran envoy placed on leave after security clearance suspended amid investigation into possible mishandling of classified material, sources say","Rob Malley, the US special envoy on Iran, has been placed on leave without pay, which occurred after his security clearance was suspended earlier this year amid an investigation into his handling of classified material, multiple sources told CNN. A US official said that Malley’s clearance was suspended amid a State Department diplomatic security investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information. Another source familiar with the matter said he was placed on unpaid leave on Thursday afternoon. “I have been informed that my security clearance is under review. I have not been provided any further information, but I expect the investigation to be resolved favorably and soon. In the meantime, I am on leave,” Malley told CNN. For a period of time following the State Department investigation, Malley remained on the job but was not allowed to access classified information, said the US official, who requested anonymity while discussing a sensitive matter. US has resumed indirect talks with Iran in effort to constrain nuclear program Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed the State Department investigation identified an issue with Malley’s security clearance. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed to CNN on Thursday afternoon that Malley was on leave, though earlier in the day he said that Malley was still the special envoy for Iran. “Rob Malley is on leave and Abram Paley is serving as acting Special Envoy for Iran and leading the Department’s work in this area,” Miller told CNN on Thursday afternoon, after earlier in the day saying that Malley remained in the role. Previously, Malley had played a key role in US efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal, one of the thorniest foreign policy challenges facing the Biden administration following former President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the agreement that Malley played an important role in negotiating under President Barack Obama. He had also played a leading role in seeking to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained in Iran. Earlier this year, two sources said, the State Department ramped up its own investigation into Malley’s handling of classified information, which led to his clearance being suspended within the last two months. It’s not clear what was uncovered that specifically led to Malley’s clearance being suspended. The sources did not have any indication there was a criminal probe related to the matter. Momentum building in Iran talks with West, says source The move to suspend Malley’s security clearance was not communicated widely within the State Department or across the Biden administration, as the department kept him in his role and made no official announcements about replacing him. Some officials at the State Department were told that Malley was handing personal matters, which is why he had taken a back seat on the Iran portfolio, two State Department officials and a third person who was briefed told CNN. In recent months, Malley has appeared to maintain a prominent role in working to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained in Iran. He has been in regular contact with the families of those held, speaking with them as recently as within the last week, two sources told CNN. Malley also engaged with the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations earlier this year, but it is unclear if those engagements came before or after his clearance was suspended. But Malley has been sidelined from the crucial effort to put constraints on Iran’s nuclear program and the Biden administration has put Brett McGurk, a top National Security Council official, into that role. Malley, who was appointed as special envoy for Iran about a week after Joe Biden took office in 2021, engaged in the efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal since the beginning of the Biden administration. But the intense efforts – which included Malley shuttling to and from the Middle East and largely working through US allies to communicate with Iran – did not produce any breakthroughs. By the end of 2022 State Department officials were saying that efforts to revive the deal were not the department’s focus, particularly as Iranian protests heated up following the of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s Morality Police. Malley worked on the Iran portfolio during the Clinton and Obama administrations. Under Obama he was part of the diplomatic negotiating team that helped craft the Iran nuclear deal. He has been a target for Iran hawks who cast him as an Iran sympathizer. Malley also has been friends with Secretary of State Antony Blinken for decades, dating back to their days as teenage classmates in Paris. ",REAL

15,McCarthy attempts damage control after questioning Trump’s strength as a candidate,"Speaker Kevin McCarthy has scrambled to contain the fallout after he suggested that former President Donald Trump might not be the strongest candidate in the 2024 presidential race – comments that outraged Trump allies and raised fresh questions on the right about why the speaker has yet to endorse Trump in the crowded GOP primary. McCarthy called Trump Tuesday morning to apologize, two sources familiar told CNN, after McCarthy said during a CNBC interview that he thinks Trump can win in 2024, but does not know if he is the “strongest” candidate. McCarthy explained to Trump that he misspoke on CNBC, and also claimed that some reporters took some of his comments out of context, the sources said. Allies were pleased with McCarthy’s apology, though several Trump advisers told CNN they were still wary of the speaker. The New York Times was first to report on the call. And the damage control didn’t end there. Not long after his call with Trump, McCarthy walked back his remarks and offered effusive praise of Trump in an exclusive interview with the right-wing publication Breitbart. A Trump campaign adviser told CNN, “I don’t think anyone can read his interview yesterday and not believe that he fully supports (Trump).” McCarthy’s campaign then also blasted out a fundraising email calling Trump the “strongest” opponent to beat President Joe Biden. McCarthy’s scramble to stay in Trump’s good graces and reiterate his loyalty both privately and publicly shows how much he is still beholden to the former president, who remains popular among McCarthy’s right flank. Yet McCarthy has refused to endorse in the primary so far – an example of the delicate tightrope he is walking when it comes to Trump. But the speaker is likely to come under increasing pressure to get off the sidelines as the race heats up, even as some senior Republicans have advised McCarthy to stay neutral, worried it could put some vulnerable House Republicans in a tough spot. Privately, there are deep misgivings among a faction of Republicans about having Trump as their presidential nominee. Some in Trump’s orbit say McCarthy has indicated to them that his endorsement could hurt Trump with far-right factions of the party that view McCarthy as part of the establishment. One Trump adviser did not scoff at this reasoning, pointing to how enraged with McCarthy some of Trump’s most ardent supporters were at the speaker’s comments Tuesday. But overall, those close to Trump expect McCarthy to ultimately endorse Trump, particularly after the former president stepped up his support for McCarthy in his speaker election earlier this year. Sources close to Trump believe the former president helped secure the speakership for McCarthy after urging House Republicans to vote for the embattled leader after McCarthy lost three straight speakership votes in January. Trump also made calls on McCarthy’s behalf ahead of the vote. McCarthy finally secured the gavel on the 15th ballot and immediately thanked the former president for his support. As of right now, however, McCarthy has no intentions of endorsing Trump – or anyone – in the primary, according to sources familiar with the speaker’s thinking, though it’s still early and his calculus could change. Since getting into the race, Trump has been aggressively courting endorsements from allies on Capitol Hill, which he believes will help solidify his status as the front-runner. So far, House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is the highest-ranking House Republican to endorse Trump. In the past, some advisers to the former president have brushed off questions as to why McCarthy has not offered an endorsement of Trump in 2024, and instead dodged the question when asked by reporters. McCarthy, too, has avoided the question. When recently asked by CNN whether he plans to endorse anyone in the primary, McCarthy said: “I could, yes, very well.” Within Trump’s world, there have been questions about why the former president hasn’t cut McCarthy loose. “He could have let him go after January 6,” one Trump ally said, pointing to a recording of McCarthy, released by The New York Times, telling GOP leaders that he would push Trump to resign after the insurrection.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying the Harvard and University of North Carolina admissions programs violated the Equal Protection Clause because they failed to offer “measurable” objectives to justify the use of race. He said the programs involve racial stereotyping and had no specific end point. Supreme Court guts affirmative action in college admissions “The Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today,” Roberts wrote. The majority opinion claims that the court was not expressly overturning prior cases authorizing race-based affirmative action and suggested that how race has affected an applicant’s life can still be part of how their application is considered. But even if the court did not formally end race-based affirmative action in higher education, its analysis will make it practically impossible for colleges and universities to take race into account – as the three Democratic appointees stressed in dissent. In a lengthy concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas, the second Black person to join the Supreme Court, spoke in unusually personal terms as he criticized the use of affirmative action policies by colleges and universities, which he described as “rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.” “While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law,” Thomas wrote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, issued a fiery dissent, saying the opinion “rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.” “The result of today’s decision is that a person’s skin color may play a role in assessing individualized suspicion, but it cannot play a role in assessing that person’s individualized contributions to a diverse learning environment,” Sotomayor wrote. “That indefensible reading of the Constitution is not grounded in law and subverts the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.” In a demonstration of the controversial nature of the case, justices read their dissents from the bench for the first time since 2019. “The devastating impact of this decision cannot be overstated,” Sotomayor said while reading a synopsis from the bench. In ending her dissent, Sotomayor quoted Dr. Martin Luther King attempting to end the opinion on an optimistic note. “As has been the case before in the history of American democracy, ‘the arc of the moral universe’ will bend toward racial justice despite the Court’s effort to impede its progress,” she said. Sotomayor pointedly did not use the customary language “I respectfully dissent.” In her own dissent, Jackson, the only Black woman on the bench, accused the majority of having a “let-them-eat-cake obliviousness” in how the ruling announced “‘colorblindness for all’ by legal fiat.” “But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life,” she said, joined by the court’s two other liberals. Jackson wrote that the majority had “detached itself from this country’s actual past and present experiences.” “No one benefits from ignorance,” she added. The ruling says that US military service academies can continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions. In a footnote in the majority opinion,  Roberts said that the cases before the court did “not address the issue” and left open the possibility that there are “potentially distinct interests that military academies may present” in a future case. During oral arguments, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar stressed the unique interests of the military and argued that race-based admissions programs further the nation’s compelling interest of diversity. Jackson called out the caveat in her dissent. “The court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore),” Jackson wrote. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy hailed the affirmative action decision, saying that the justices “just ruled that no American should be denied educational opportunities because of race.” And Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, “This is a great day for all Americans.” Former President Donald Trump called Thursday a “great day for America.” “People with extraordinary ability and everything else necessary for success, including future greatness for our country, are finally being rewarded,” Trump said on Truth Social. “This is the ruling everyone was waiting and hoping for and the result was amazing.” Trump transformed the court when he nominated three of the justices in the conservative majority. Another 2024 GOP contender, former Vice President Mike Pence, also celebrated the ruling. “There is no place for discrimination based on race in the United States, and I am pleased that the Supreme Court has put an end to this egregious violation of civil and constitutional rights in admissions processes, which only served to perpetuate racism,” Pence said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling “a giant roadblock in our country’s march toward racial justice.” “The consequences of this decision will be felt immediately and across the country, as students of color will face an admission cycle next year with fewer opportunities to attend the same colleges and universities than their parents and older siblings,” the New York Democrat said. CNN Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates said the Supreme Court’s decision will have sweeping changes to education in the US. “This opinion, make no mistake about it, it is going to change the landscape of education, and this is what the majority has asked for,” she said. Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the decision will still not end the legal fight over college admissions. “In those states that have already banned racial preferences and gone after diversity statements and other softer uses of race in admissions, the decision is going to make it virtually impossible for colleges and universities to take race into account in any specific admissions decision,” Vladeck said. “But in states that continue to permit colleges and universities to take race into account, we’ll surely see efforts to encourage the kinds of uses the majority does not expressly disavow –whether in diversity statements or elsewhere – and litigation challenging those efforts as being inconsistent with the spirit, if not the letter, of today’s decision.” Challengers in the case targeted Harvard and the University of North Carolina, arguing that their programs violate equal protection principles, dashed the promise of a colorblind society and discriminated against Asian Americans. They asked the court to overturn precedent and insist that higher education should explore and further develop race-neutral alternatives to achieve diversity. A conservative group, Students for Fair Admissions was behind both challenges. Supreme Court revives case brought by postal worker seeking religious accommodations SSFA argued the UNC and Harvard policies violated Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits schools receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race as well. The lawyers also argued that the UNC violated the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law, which covers state universities. Lower US courts had ruled in favor of the schools, finding that that the programs used race in a sufficiently limited way to fulfill a compelling interest in diversity. After an eight-day trial in 2020, District Court Judge Loretta C. Biggs of the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina ruled in favor of the school, making special mention of its history steeped in racism. “The University continues to face challenges admitting and enrolling underrepresented minorities particularly African American males, Hispanics, and Native Americans,” Biggs said, adding that in 2013 enrollment of Black men in the first-year class fell below 100 students. The Supreme Court stepped in to consider the case before it was heard by a federal appeals court. Harvard’s program is like that of University of North Carolina, but the challenge focused particularly on the treatment of Asian American students and a charge that the school intentionally discriminates against them by setting higher standards for their admission. While Harvard is a private university, it is still subject to Title VI because it receives public funds. Its freshman class in 2019 had 1,600 students out of 35,000 applicants. Of the 35,000, 2,700 had perfect verbal SAT scores, 3,400 had perfect math SAT scores and more than 8,000 had perfect grade point averages. After a 15-day bench trial that featured thirty witnesses the district court ruled in favor of Harvard, finding that the school did not discriminate against Asian Americans in violation of Title VI. Challenge to Harvard's use of affirmative action was designed by a conservative to reach a friendly Supreme Court The 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court holding that it did “not clearly err in finding that Harvard did not intentionally discriminate against Asian Americans. ” The admissions process at the school takes into consideration several components including pre-application recruitment efforts, applications, a “first read” of application materials, and interviews.   The reading procedures include guidelines to assign numerical numbers to certain categories to detail the factors admissions officers should consider. Those factors include academic ratings, extracurricular ratings, athletic ratings, and personal ratings. The personal ratings attempt to measure how an applicant impacts people around them and contributions they might make. Considerations include perceived leadership, maturity, self-confidence, likeability, courage and kindness. After SFFA brought the suit, Harvard modified its instructions to say that an applicant’s race or ethnicity should not be considered in assigning the personal ratings. Harvard has a list of so-called “tip” factors, including race, that are used after the first read process. Cameron T. Norris, the SSFA lawyer who argued the Harvard case, charged the school with ignoring precedent and the “mistreatment” of Asian-American applicants. “Its admissions process penalizes them for supposedly lacking as much leadership, confidence likability, or kindness as White applicants,” he said, and said that Harvard “engages in admitted racial balancing and ignores race-neutral alternatives.” He particularly attacked Harvard’s system based on so-called “personal ratings.” By considering race alongside subjective criteria like “self-confidence, likability, and courage,” universities invite admissions officers to rely on anti-Asian stereotypes, Norris added. Prelogar supported both Harvard and the University of North Carolina, urging the justices to reject the invitation to ignore court precedent stemming from the Court’s 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, where Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. recognized that the nation’s future “depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

9,What we know about the document Trump mentioned in the taped Bedminster meeting,"The tape of a conversation with Donald Trump and others made at his golf club in New Jersey has become perhaps the most critical publicly known evidence in the federal indictment against the former president. Special counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with mishandling classified information after leaving the White House. And the recording – parts of which were made public by CNN earlier this week – features Trump in July 2021 discussing what he called a “highly confidential” Pentagon document that contained “secret” US military plans to attack Iran. Trump has offered a firehose of differing and contradictory explanations of what he claimed happened. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Here’s a breakdown of what we know about the document, and what Trump has said about it. Prosecutors revealed some key details in their 44-page indictment against Trump. Importantly, prosecutors said Trump “showed and described” the document during the recorded meeting. CNN and other news outlets reported that one of the Trump staffers was Margo Martin, a communications specialist, who previously worked with Trump during his presidency. The other staffer in the room was Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson. The writer and publisher were there to interview Trump for the then-upcoming autobiography of Mark Meadows, who was Trump’s final chief of staff. Meadows’ memoir, which was released in December 2021, appears to reference the meeting. “The president recalls a four-page report typed up by Mark Milley himself,” Meadows’ book says, referring to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. “It contained the general’s own plan to attack Iran, deploying massive numbers of troops, something he urged President Trump to do more than once during his presidency. President Trump denied those requests every time.” The book additionally bashes Milley for bad-mouthing Trump in the press. During the taped meeting, Trump is heard using the “highly classified” Iran attack plan to push back on Milley’s public comments that Trump tried to start a war. Before indicting Trump, federal investigators asked witnesses about the Bedminster tape and the Pentagon document, while they were testifying to the grand jury. Investigators also questioned Milley. The special counsel’s grand jury also heard from Martin, the Trump aide who attended the Bedminster meeting. Immediately after her testimony, prosecutors issued a new subpoena to Trump, demanding that he return the Pentagon document about Iran, and related material. Trump’s team turned over some Milley-related documents, but said it couldn’t find the specific document that Trump mentioned during the meeting with Meadows’ biographers. Prosecutors charged Trump with mishandling 31 sensitive documents, though it’s unclear if any of the charges pertain to the Iran attack plan. Regardless, prosecutors quoted extensively from the Bedminster tape in the indictment, demonstrating that after leaving the White House, Trump knew he still possessed sensitive government secrets, and that they hadn’t been declassified. Trump has offered several convoluted and contradictory explanations about the Bedminster meeting. At a CNN town hall on May 11, Trump was asked if he showed classified documents to anyone after leaving office. He said, “Not really. I would have the right to. By the way, they were declassified.” When pressed again on the same question, he said, “Not that I can think of.” After his indictment, but before the tape became public, Trump ramped up his denial, telling Fox News “there was no document” shown at Bedminster, just news clippings. “There was no document. That was a massive amount of papers and everything else talking about Iran and other things,” Trump said in the interview which aired on June 19. “And it may have been held up or may not, but that was not a document. I didn’t have a document, per se. There was nothing to declassify. These were newspaper stories, magazine stories and articles.” Exclusive: Rudy Giuliani interviewed in special counsel's 2020 election interference probe But CNN’s report Monday about the Bedminster tape revealed that Trump told those in the room, “These are the papers,” while discussing the Iran plans. That line was not in the indictment. After a 2024 campaign event Wednesday in New Hampshire, Trump told Fox News that after leaving the White House, he held onto “copies of different plans” as well as “newspaper articles” and magazine clippings. His comment about possessing “plans” raised eyebrows, because it was seen as an indication that he did in fact mishandle the US attack plan for Iran. Shortly after those comments, a Trump campaign spokesperson told CNN Trump was referring to “political plans.” Trump later told reporters he was actually referring to “plans for a golf course” and “building plans.” He also repeated his denial that he “didn’t have documents.” ",REAL
58,"Special counsel office still investigating Trump’s handling of documents, sources say","The special counsel’s office is continuing to investigate around Donald Trump’s handling of documents after his presidency ended, multiple sources tell CNN. That includes continued grand jury activity in Florida and inquiries of witnesses, though it is not yet clear what aspects of the investigation the prosecutors are still pushing toward. The historic indictment last month of Trump and his aide Walt Nauta already tells a thorough story with photos, text messages and witness accounts about how Trump allegedly held onto national defense records after his presidency. Prosecutors also accuse both men of lying to investigators and trying to conceal the records from being repossessed by the federal government by moving them throughout his Mar-a-Lago club. Trump has pleaded not guilty, and Nauta is expected to enter a plea of not guilty next week. The two men are expected to head to trial as early as this year. It’s not unheard of for investigators working a case to continue asking questions following the filing of initial charges, though the Trump case is unusual given the former president continues to run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024. And the documents case on file against Trump and Nauta left out several threads investigators pursued as recently as May, including questions about possible gaps in surveillance tapes and the handling of records at Trump’s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey in 2022. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment on Thursday. This story has been updated with additional details ",REAL
56,Hunter Biden settles Arkansas child support case,"Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, has settled his child support case in Arkansas, reaching an agreement with the mother of one of his children and resolving a dispute that became a legal headache for him in recent months. The settlement was announced in a court filing Thursday in Arkansas state court. Coupled with his impending guilty plea to federal tax offenses, it appears that the president’s son is taking significant steps to put to rest some of his long-simmering legal entanglements. However, the legal resolutions won’t end the political drama surrounding Hunter Biden, the White House, Republican lawmakers and GOP presidential contenders. President Biden denies he was present during alleged Hunter Biden 2017 text The child support case began as a paternity dispute in 2019, after Lunden Roberts, an Arkansas woman, gave birth to a girl and claimed Hunter Biden was the father. He denied paternity, but after a DNA test confirmed that he was the father, he eventually agreed in 2020 to pay $20,000-a-month in child support. Hunter Biden was seeking to reduce the monthly payments. It’s not clear from the court filings what his new payments will be – that information is redacted. As part of the deal, Hunter Biden will give some of his paintings to his daughter, who can either keep some of her choosing or keep the money from any sales of these paintings. As part of his recovery from drug and alcohol addiction, Hunter Biden has taken up painting, but his art sales have created lingering ethics questions for the White House. Roberts is also dropping her bid to change the girl’s last name to “Biden,” according to the court filing. Hunter Biden reopened the case last year, citing his changed financial situation and a sizable drop in income. This was a risky move because it gave Roberts and her attorneys – who are well-known GOP activists and supporters of former President Donald Trump – an opportunity to seek a wide array of Hunter Biden’s financial records. They sought information about his taxes, overseas business deals and financial transactions within the Biden family. These records have also been of keen interest to House Republicans, who have spent months looking for evidence to corroborate their claims that Joe Biden was involved in corrupt deals with his son. Hunter Biden's aggressive new legal strategy initially caused anxiety at White House By settling the child support case, Hunter Biden appears to have staved off an upcoming contempt hearing in Arkansas, where he could’ve possibly faced fines or maybe even jail if a judge believed he stonewalled Roberts’ attempts to obtain his financial data. A trial to determine whether to adjust the child support had been scheduled for late July. In court filings in April, Roberts said Hunter Biden “has never seen or contacted” his four-year-old daughter and that President Biden and first lady Jill Biden “remain estranged” from their grandchild. This story has been updated with additional details. ",REAL

20,Blinken says US told Israel that violence with Palestinians could jeopardize possible normalization with Saudi Arabia,"The United States has stressed to Israel that the explosion of tensions with the Palestinians will make it virtually impossible to expand normalization agreements with Arab nations, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, adding that the Israeli government has taken some escalatory steps, including on settlements. “We told our friends and allies in Israel that if there’s a fire burning in their backyard, it’s going to be a lot tougher, if not impossible, to actually both deepen the existing agreements, as well as to expand them, to include potentially Saudi Arabia,” Blinken said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations. The top US diplomat said he had raised the issue in conversations with Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken also said they had also raised “practical” issues related to its policies. “If Israel were to find itself either by intent or by accident responsible for the West Bank, with three million Palestinians and five hundred plus thousand settlers, what is that going to mean in terms of the allocation of resources, including security resources that Israel otherwise be concerned about when it comes to Gaza, when it comes to Lebanon, when it comes to Iran. It doesn’t really add up,” Blinken said. Netanyahu urges Israeli settlers not to 'grab land illegally,' following West Bank violence Blinken said the US had urged Israel to take steps toward de-escalation, which had “some success, particularly during the holiday season” of Easter, Passover and Ramadan. “Now, however, we have steps taken, including on settlements, that are moving in the opposite direction,” he said. Israel has already secured diplomatic agreements with several Arab nations, including Morocco, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. After his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Blinken reaffirmed the Biden administration’s commitment to normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying he discussed the matter in his meetings with Saudi officials. “We fully support Israel’s integration into the Middle East and from day one, we have been working both to deepen some of the existing agreements and also expand them to other countries. That includes Saudi Arabia,” Blinken said at a news conference in early June. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, speaking alongside Blinken, noted that “it’s quite clear that we believe that normalization is in the interest of the region, that it would bring significant benefits to all. But without finding a pathway to peace for the Palestinian people, without addressing that challenge, any normalization will have limited benefits.” According to the State Department, Blinken spoke with Netanyahu following the trip about “areas of mutual interest, including expanding and deepening Israel’s integration into the Middle East through normalization with countries in the region.” ",REAL
16,Biden unveils his 2024 sales pitch for ‘Bidenomics.’ Is anyone buying?,"President Joe Biden’s top economic advisers believe the worst effects of inflation are in the rear-view mirror. They are increasingly confident the economy is heading for a soft-landing, averting a recession. And a growing number of economists are beginning to agree. There’s just one problem: most Americans are convinced the economy is in bad shape, and they blame the president. Enter “Bidenomics.” Searching for a solution to Americans’ negative perception of the economy and a vehicle to take credit for an economy that is increasingly trending in the right direction – all as Biden’s reelection campaign gets underway – the White House is embracing the term. “Bidenomics” was at the heart of a major economic speech the president delivered Wednesday in Chicago, where he ticked through positive economic indicators and outlined a vision of economic revival. “I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics,” Biden said at the Old Chicago Main Post Office. “I didn’t come up with a name,” he said, crediting the news media for inventing the term Bidenomics. “I really didn’t. I now claim it.” Ahead of the speech, aides described the address as an opportunity for Biden to lay out his economic vision for the future while also articulating how he believes his economic policies have delivered so far. But it was also an opportunity for Biden to explain what his economic policy was not. “Folks, let me say as clearly as I can, the trickle-down approach failed the middle class. It failed America, blew up the deficit, increased inequity and weakened our infrastructure,” he said. Throughout his speech, Biden took aim at his predecessor for failing to accomplish what he’d promised, including improving the nation’s infrastructure. And he vowed to continue pressing for tax increases on the wealthy and expanding childcare and education access, both items he’s unsuccessfully sought during his first term. Those items are opposed by many Republicans, but Biden said his agenda could unify Americans. “I think we’re going to help lessen the division in this country by bringing us back together,” he said. “It makes it awful hard to demagogue something when it’s working.” White House officials have been preparing a more comprehensive economic messaging push for months and the decision to launch now reflects the White House’s settled confidence that the economy’s positive trajectory is sustainable. The debt ceiling impasse also needed to be resolved and Biden’s key economic legislation needed to begin to be implemented. Now, officials see Bidenomics as an opportunity to tie together the president’s economic accomplishments, the vision behind those policies and a growing economy under one term. “Bidenomics is rooted in the simple idea that we need to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down,” reads a bolded section of a memo distributed by two of the president’s senior advisers, Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon, earlier this week. That Dunn and Donilon are messaging experts and not economists is a telling sign of the origins of “Bidenomics” as partly a branding exercise. Aides are hopeful a more concerted effort to convince Americans of the economy’s strength – and Biden’s own role in managing it – will improve his political standing. How much a new name can help in that effort remains to be seen. Biden has been traveling the country for the better part of two years talking about his efforts to boost manufacturing, invest in new infrastructure and create job training programs for Americans without college degrees. Though polls show Americans broadly support elements of Biden’s economic agenda – a point Dunn and Donilon made in their three-page memo – a wide swath of Americans continue to widely disapprove of how he’s handled the economy: 66%, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in May. That same poll showed most Americans view the economy as lackluster, with 76% describing it as in poor shape, up from 71% who felt that way in March. Asked about the disconnect between increasingly positive economic data and Americans’ perceptions of the economy, Biden’s chief economic adviser Lael Brainard pointed to the “record economic uncertainty” that Americans have faced over the last two years as the country emerged from the pandemic and experienced the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “What the president would say is people need to see it. They need to see it in their communities. And that’s what his policies are all about,” Brainard said in an interview. “As Americans see that and experience it, the president is confident that they are going to feel much more optimistic about their own economic futures.” While the president’s top messaging advisers home in on the “Bidenomics” term as a way to lift up his economic record and contrast it with Republican economic policies, the prominent push also runs the risk of Republicans co-opting it to describe the not-so-bright spots in the current economy or to tie the president to the still-looming possibility of another economic downturn. “It’s really not about a term,” Brainard said when asked about how Republicans might co-opt it. “It’s not about a word. It’s about an economic plan that the president has put in place that is in contrast with trickle down (policies).” “Listen, even if the economy is doing well, the Republicans will say it’s doing poorly,” Dunn, the president’s senior adviser, said on MSNBC earlier this week. “So, we’re not going to spend a huge amount of time worrying about them.” Attaching a “-nomics” to the end of a president’s name has been routine since President Richard Nixon. As often as not, it’s used as a pejorative by opponents; nothing helps simplify something as complicated as a bad economy than a buzzword. No president has been more associated with a “-nomics” than Ronald Reagan, whose “Reaganomics” described a supply-side, trickle-down approach that has largely defined Republican economic policy for the last 40 years. Biden has made little attempt at disguising his distaste for that approach; he’s made a part of his stump speech a takedown of policies he insists will never benefit middle-class, blue-collar workers. “Not a lot trickled down to my parents’ kitchen table when I was growing up,” Biden has said in various forms over the past several years (never mind that Biden was in his 40s during Reagan’s attempt at trickle-down economics). Bidenomics, at least in the White House’s definition, is as much identified by what it is not as it is by a particular set of policies or ideas. “If Reaganomics was based on the idea that if you cut taxes for the wealthiest corporations, the wealthiest people in this society, and that at some point, the remnants of those will trickle down to the middle class and the working class, Bidenomics is the exact opposite. Bidenomics says that the way to grow the economy in this country is you grow the middle class,” Dunn said on MSNBC. Biden himself seemed surprised this month that his surname had achieved “-nomics” status. “I didn’t realize I had Bidenomics going,” he said during a news conference with his British counterpart on June 8, suggesting he’d learned the term in the pages of the Wall Street Journal. Ten days later – as the White House put the final touches on the forthcoming messaging push – he hadn’t seemed to achieve any more clarity on what, exactly, this theory of his was. “We decided to replace this theory (trickle-down economics) with what the press has now called ‘Bidenomics,’” he said during a political rally with union members in Philadelphia. “I don’t know what the hell that is. But it’s working.” But when faced with the question of whether “Bidenomics” can be the answer to changing public perception of the president’s record, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered a frank reply: “We’re going to try.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told reporters Wednesday he had evidence that Roblox was actively silencing conservative voices. “Today, on Roblox, I was disgusted to find that my highly customized avatar, my in-game achievements, and my friends list had been totally wiped, all because I dared to speak my mind as a white, conservative man in America,” said Gaetz, who added that the gaming platform, which is popular among adolescents, had consistently and pervasively discriminated against prominent, outspoken Republican legislators and pundits like him. “As an active member of Roblox since 2017, I was disturbed, but not surprised, to find that the liberal elite had conspired to remove my friendship badge and ban me from playing my favorite pizza game on my private Discord server with my 900 mutuals. What if conservatives want to hunt virtual easter eggs or attend a Roblox Twenty One Pilots concert? The leftists in charge of Roblox are trying to prevent conservatives from seeking the truth and learning what users are wearing, where they live, and if their parents are home. Until we have a Roblox that supports free speech, people like me will always be second-class citizens.” At press time, Gaetz could not be reached for comment after evidence surfaced that he had sent a large number of Robux transactions to underage girls.",FAKE
34,Raphael Warnock Loses All Faith In God After Being Forced Into Runoff Against Herschel Walker,"ATLANTA—Struggling  to cope with his shock at the outcome of the midterm elections, Sen.Raphael Warnock (D-GA)reportedly lost all faith in God this week after being forced  into a runoff against Herschel Walker. “What loving creator would create  a world where I’m required to compete in not one, but two elections  against a man like Herschel Walker?” said the visibly shaken Warnock,  who removed his glasses in disbelief as he wrestled with the grave  theological implications of being a mere percentage point away from  losing to a former football player who allegedly threatened to murder  his own family members. “Is this some sort of divine test? No, it is  much, much worse. I have been a person of faith for 52 years on this  planet and every moment was a rotten lie. There’s no meaning in this  twisted universe. There is no God watching over us, and, surely, if there is any  sort of deity, he is a wicked being who tortures us for His pleasure.  Don’t call me reverend. I am not God’s emissary.

Honestly, I almost felt bad for the guy. It took him 45 minutes just to call his militia and ask if he should kill the guy in front of me for supposedly committing voter fraud.” At press time, Jenkins told reporters that he was ultimately just grateful he made it to work on time, because as he was leaving, the elderly poll watcher saw a Black voter, clutched his chest, and collapsed.",FAKE
8,‘Hell-bent on destruction:’ Senators fume over growing number of blocked nominations,"Nearly five months after Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville announced his hold on Department of Defense nominees, the tactic has become a major flashpoint within the US Senate as institutionalists inside the body are voicing concerns the hold could have long-term repercussions and are openly warning an overhaul of the nominations process could be needed. Despite efforts from Republican colleagues, Tuberville’s been resolute, holding up the nomination of roughly 250 military nominees – many promotions that would typically be fast-tracked through the Senate. The dramatic impasse is forcing senators to openly question if it’s time for the body to consider changing the rules or at the very least limit the number of nominations that require Senate confirmation. “Maybe we need another gang to come up with a set of rules changes, but the vast majority of us who understand these tools should be used sparingly, I think we need to raise our voices,” Sen, Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said. The angst is bipartisan as senators are grow wary of a further roadblocks in a Senate that is already doing very little legislating in divided government. “Are we all gonna start taking hostages now?” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said. A hold in the Senate can’t ultimately stop a nominee from being confirmed. But, it can force Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to burn valuable floor time on a process that may otherwise have moved much more quickly. It’s a tactic that has been used in the past and escalated last Congress when GOP Sen. Josh Hawley held up Pentagon nominees for several months over the Biden administration’s handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. But what makes Tuberville’s hold more dramatic is the fact it also includes a hold on military promotions, which senators argue aren’t political nominees. In the case of Tuberville’s holds, there are now more than 250 military promotions and nominations delayed. Putting every single one of them on the floor would take months to complete. Tuberville’s move stems from his opposition to a Pentagon abortion policy. Tuberville’s hold is far and away the most impactful in the Senate, but it’s not the only obstacle nominees are facing. Republican Sen. J.D. Vance announced in June he’d place a hold over Department of Justice nominees after Trump was indicted on federal charges, but there are only two nominees in the pipeline – both of whom were always expected to require significant floor time to be approved. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has warned he will oppose Biden administration health nominees as he pushes the administration to do more to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The mere optics of agency-wide opposition is becoming a major issue for senators who say it’s chipping away at Senate decorum and efficiency. “If you don’t like someone who has been nominated then vote against them,” New Hampshire Democrat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. “To hold up over things is not in the best interest of the national security of the country. We’ve got all these ambassadors, general officers. Now we are talking about holding all the nominees for the Department of Justice. If you don’t want to be here and work on policy then why did you come?” It’s not uncommon for a lawmaker to use a hold on a single nominee either because of concerns with the nominee or as a way to extract leverage from the administration, but members complain the rise in agency-wide holds is being abused and undermining the Senate’s ability to perform a core role. “Holding up one nominee or even a short hold on a handful of nominees has been a way that senators from time to time have exercised a little leverage against an agency that wouldn’t cough up information or an administration that wouldn’t put out a report, but it has completely changed now,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said. “Now these are holds that are broad and in Sen. Tuberville’s case undermine our national security. That’s a kind of hell-bent on destruction that is one more sign of how broken this Congress has become.” Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons argued the uptick in agency-wide opposition is “risking further degrading the ability of the Senate to perform its essential function of advice and consent.” Some members are so fed up they are arguing the Senate needs to look at overhauling the rules of nominations. “One person shouldn’t be able to take an action like this. We need to look at the Senate rules to think about whether we should say it has to be at least five people instead of one person,” Independent Sen. Angus King argued. It’s a delicate balance though. Any action that Senate Democrats take now to address Tuberville’s holds on military promotions would have to be incredibly tailored or Democrats run the risk of Republicans using their rules change in the future to speed up nominees Democrats may find controversial. Another option would be to pass a law that allows military promotions to advance without Senate consent, but it’s not clear that would have the votes to pass. Lawmakers could also limit the number of nominees that need Senate confirmation, a process that would need bipartisan buy in. “Do we really need deputy assistant secretaries to go through this whole process?” Warner said. “The other thing is many of these men and women who want to serve for appointed positions have to literally put their lives literally in limbo for sometimes six to 12 months.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, warned that he believes in senators being able to use their leverage over nominees, but even he is worried that if agency-wide holds get used too often, it will prompt a rules change. “We should make sure that we give each senator as much power as we can. It was meant to be that way, it’s always been that way. I just want to make sure it isn’t abused to the point where we maybe change the rules, that’s a slippery slope,” Grassley said. For their part, senators with agency-wide holds argue it’s their prerogative to use the rules in their favor. “Well, this group will try to change anything to make it work for them. But this is the rules. We can make a hold on anything we want,” Tuberville said. Vance said he stands by his hold. “I think the way that Merrick Garland has politicized the Justice Department sets a bad precedent for American justice and somebody needs to push back against it,” Vance said. For now, Democratic leaders aren’t planning any immediate action, instead hoping that GOP leadership will find a way to talk Tuberville out of his hold. “We’re trying everything we can think of, but most of all, we’re appealing to other Republicans who we think are reasonable to come to their senses,” Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said.

55,Justices Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson criticize each other in unusually sharp language in affirmative action case,"The Supreme Court’s landmark ruling Thursday on affirmative action pitted its two Black justices against each other, with the ideologically opposed jurists employing unusually sharp language attacking each other by name. The majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts said colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission, saying programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated the Equal Protection Clause because they failed to offer “measurable” objectives to justify the use of race. Supreme Court guts affirmative action in college admissions Justice Clarence Thomas and the court’s other four conservatives joined Roberts’ opinion. But Thomas, who in 1991 became the second Black person to ascend to the nation’s highest court, issued a lengthy concurrence that attacked such admissions programs and tore into arguments posited by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to join the court, who penned her own fiery dissent in the case. Thomas has previously acknowledged that he made it to Yale Law School because of affirmative action, but he has long criticized such policies. He spoke in personal terms in his concurrence as he put forth his argument against the use of the policies, which he described as “rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.” “Even in the segregated South where I grew up, individuals were not the sum of their skin color,” Thomas wrote. “While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination,” he added, “I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law.” As he read his concurrence from the bench on Thursday, Jackson, who joined the court last year, stared blankly ahead. Though Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench, Jackson did not read her own dissent, in which she went after Thomas’ concurrence and accused the majority of having a “let-them-eat-cake obliviousness” in how the ruling announced “‘colorblindness for all’ by legal fiat.” A footnote near the end of Jackson’s dissent went after the concurrence by Thomas, with the liberal justice accusing her colleague of demonstrating “an obsession with race consciousness that far outstrips my or UNC’s holistic understanding that race can be a factor that affects applicants’ unique life experiences.” “Justice Thomas ignites too many more straw men to list, or fully extinguish, here,” Jackson wrote. “The takeaway is that those who demand that no one think about race (a classic pink-elephant paradox) refuse to see, much less solve for, the elephant in the room – the race-linked disparities that continue to impede achievement of our great Nation’s full potential.” In her broader dissent, Jackson said that the argument made by the challengers that affirmative action programs are unfair “blinks both history and reality in ways too numerous to count.” “But the response is simple: Our country has never been colorblind,” Jackson said. (While Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case, she did hear the UNC case, and her dissent was focused on the latter.) Thomas then explicitly attacks Jackson’s opinion. “As she sees things, we are all inexorably trapped in a fundamentally racist society, with the original sin of slavery and the historical subjugation of black Americans still determining our lives today,” Thomas wrote. “Worse still, Justice Jackson uses her broad observations about statistical relationships between race and select measures of health, wealth, and well-being to label all blacks as victims,” Thomas wrote at another point in his concurrence. “Her desire to do so is unfathomable to me.” Thomas, one of the court’s most conservative members, has long been known for his distaste for affirmative action policies. He has been open about the fact that he made it to Yale because of affirmative action, but says the stigma of preferential treatment made it difficult for him to find a job after college. In his memoir, “My Grandfather’s Son,” Thomas says he felt “tricked” by paternalistic Whites at Yale who recruited Black students. “After graduating from Yale, I met a black alumnus of the University of Michigan Law School who told me that he’d made a point of not mentioning his race on his application. I wished with all my heart that I’d done the same,” he wrote. “I learned the hard way that a law degree from Yale meant one thing for White graduates and another for blacks, no matter how much anyone denied it,” Thomas wrote. “As a symbol of my disillusionment, I peeled a fifteen-cent price sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I’d made by going to Yale.” He dissented in the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger, which allowed for the limited use of race in college admissions. “I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators,” he wrote in his dissent.

14,Ad wars heat up in the 2024 presidential race as spending nears $70 million,"Former President Donald Trump is dominating cable airwaves, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is betting on Iowa and South Carolina, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is blanketing New Hampshire as candidates tailor their ad spending with the 2024 presidential race heating up. Spending data from AdImpact shows how the various White House contenders have different strategies for the early primary map, investing resources in the states and messages they hope can serve as launching pads to the nomination – spending nearly $70 million along the way. Allies of Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, have taken a unique approach among the crowded field, devoting more than three-quarters of their ad spending dollars to national cable advertising campaign. MAGA Inc., the super PAC backing his campaign, has spent $15.7 million on national cable advertising out of a total of nearly $20 million in ad spending so far. The pro-Trump group has split the rest of its spending, a little more than $4 million, between Iowa and New Hampshire. Reflecting that strategy, in the last month, MAGA Inc. spent $1.6 million on an ad running in major media markets (Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia) which criticizes the former president’s indictment in the classified documents case. The super PAC has also kept ads attacking DeSantis in rotation in the early primary states. There are also hints at the strategy of DeSantis’ camp in the ad spending of a super PAC backing his campaign, Never Back Down. The group has spent a total of about $15.5 million on advertising so far, directing $4.3 million to Iowa and $3.7 million to South Carolina. On Tuesday, the group launched a new TV spot in Iowa proclaiming that DeSantis was “waging a war on woke and winning.” By contrast, the group has spent just $1.3 million in New Hampshire so far. Notably, Never Back Down has spent about $630,000 in Nevada, another early voting state, making it the only GOP group with a significant presence on the airwaves there. The group has also spent about $5 million on national cable advertising. South Carolina Sen Tim. Scott – another top advertiser in the early going of the White House race – has taken a traditional approach to ad budgeting, splitting his advertising between Iowa, where he’s spent about $3.5 million, and New Hampshire, where he’s spent about $2 million. In both states, he’s been a steady presence on the air, running ads that tout his “conservative values” and feature clips from the campaign trail. And the super PAC allied with Scott has followed a similar pattern, spending about $3.1 million in Iowa and $1.9 million in New Hampshire. Unlike the Trump and DeSantis super PACs, Scott and his camp have spent little on national advertising campaigns. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s Burgum has emerged as the top advertiser in New Hampshire so far, spending more than $2.1 million in the state as the independently wealthy candidate works to raise his profile among voters. Burgum has also spent $2 million advertising in Iowa. Excluding outside groups, only Scott has spent more on campaign advertising – and even including the super PACs, Burgum is the fifth biggest advertiser in the race so far.

That amount is nearly double what had been spent at this point in the last presidential cycle – during a competitive Democratic primary – when all candidates and groups had spent about $35 million in the first six months of 2019. This year, Trump’s super PAC, DeSantis’ super PAC, Scott and his super PAC, and Burgum account for over half that total, combining to spend just over $50 million. Only two other candidates have spent more than $1 million on ads so far: Vivek Ramaswamy and Perry Johnson, both of whom are independently wealthy businessmen self-funding their campaigns. And while candidates have taken different approaches to investing their resources, the traditional early voting states are continuing to draw the lion’s share of the ad dollars. Candidates and groups have spent about $17.4 million in Iowa, $10.9 million in New Hampshire, $3.9 million in South Carolina, and $830,000 in Nevada. The ad wars are heating up as candidates in the crowded GOP field are scrambling to qualify for the first presidential debate in August. Several long-shot Republican presidential candidates, with smaller budgets for TV advertising, have been appealing to donors online to help them make the debate stage after the Republican National Committee released the qualification requirements, which include both polling and fundraising thresholds. As he seeks to nab the 40,000 individual donors required to be on stage, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is up with Facebook ads that read, “I am running for President to bring out the best in America. From securing the border to creating a robust economy, I have the experience to deliver. Chip in $3, $5, or $10 today to help me get on the debate stage and move our nation forward.” Ramaswamy – who is self-funding his campaign – is also urging supporters to help him qualify. “To secure a prime spot on the debate stage, we need solid polling numbers AND unique grassroots donors. Can you chip in just $1 today to help get to the debate stage?,” one of Ramaswamy’s ads says. And Johnson, the wealthy Michigan businessman, is making similar appeals. “Even though I’m self-funding, the RNC is requiring that I get 40,000 donors to make the debate stage. Can you donate $1 NOW to ensure that I make the cut to share my plan to stop inflation and balance the budget?,” reads one of his ads. ",REAL
7,Michigan lawmakers pass ban on ‘conversion therapy’ for minors,"Michigan’s Democratic-controlled state legislature gave final approval this week to a pair of bills that would ban so-called conversion therapy for minors, joining other blue states in advancing protections for the LGBTQ community this legislative session. The state Senate voted largely along party lines Tuesday to advance the ban on “conversion therapy,” a scientifically discredited practice intended to change a person’s sexual orientation. The bills, which were passed by the state House earlier this month, now head to the desk of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who signed an executive directive in 2021 that blocked the use of federal and state funds for conversion therapy on minors. CNN has reached out to Whitmer’s office to inquire what action she plans to take on the legislation. If Whitmer signs the bills, Michigan will become the 22nd state to ban conversion therapy, according to the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention efforts among LGBTQ youth. In April, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed such a ban into law. House Bill 4616 prohibits mental health professionals from engaging in conversion therapy with minors. Under the bill, any violation will result in the mental health professional facing disciplinary action, which could include a suspended or revoked license. House Bill 4617, meanwhile, aims to add the definition of conversion therapy to the state’s mental health code. It defines the term as “any practice or treatment by a mental health professional that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity, including, but not limited to, efforts to change behavior or gender expression or to reduce or eliminate sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward an individual of the same gender.” The bills would take effect 90 days after the governor signs them into law. The Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, applauded Michigan lawmakers for passing the bills, which they called “critical.” Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for HRC, said in a statement Tuesday that “no one should live in fear of being subjected to the discredited and dangerous practice.” “While it’s a shame that this practice has been allowed to take place for so long, today’s passage is just another example of how Michigan is rapidly progressing toward being a more inclusive and safe state for LGBTQ+ people,” Warbelow continued. LGBTQ rights have become a prominent issue in state legislatures nationwide as Democratic and Republican lawmakers look to push opposing bills that advance or curtail protections. Earlier this week, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed an executive order that prohibits state resources from being used to support conversion therapy on minors. And in Michigan – where Democrats now control the governorship and both legislative chambers for the first time in roughly four decades – Whitmer signed a bill earlier this year that expanded the state’s Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against “sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.” ",REAL
33,Ted Cruz Announces Plans To Once Again Like Porn On 9/11,"WASHINGTON—Telling reporters it was the least he could do to honor the Americans who tragically lost their lives in the attacks, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) announced plans Monday to once again like porn on the anniversary of 9/11. “Next Sept. 11, I promise the American people that I will, just like I did several years ago, open my personal Twitter account, browse through several posts featuring busty pornographic actors, and indicate that I like one of them,” said Cruz, adding that much like Sept. 11, 2017, when he caused a stir by favoriting a two-minute hardcore porn video on Twitter, his public engagement with the tweet  would be a source of embarrassment for him but would also make him incredibly horny. “On such a dark, tragic day in our nation’s history, it is my duty as an elected official to log onto Twitter, type ‘boobs,’ ‘sex,’ or ‘naked women’ into the search bar; scroll through several explicit videos and images; and then click on a sexually graphic post that reveals something deep, disturbing, and hypocritical about myself and my sexual preference—something you, my constituents, and the American public can never, ever forget. I promise you, whatever porn I like on Sept. 11, I will attempt to hide the fact that I ever did it, denying it fervently and perhaps even blaming a junior staffer. But by then, several people will have already taken screenshots and shared it widely across the internet. You have my word.” Cruz went on to state that as with the last time he liked a porn post on Sept. 11, he planned to get off primarily on the public shaming, which he promised would cause him to ejaculate both forcefully and repeatedly.",FAKE
4,Judge temporarily blocks Kentucky’s ban on gender-affirming care for youth,"A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked Kentucky Senate Bill 150, which would have prohibited transgender minors from receiving several forms of gender-affirming care. The ruling stops the law from taking effect while other courts hear challenges to the law. “Based on the evidence submitted, the court finds that the treatments barred by SB 150 are medically appropriate and necessary for some transgender children… These drugs have a long history of safe use in minors for various conditions,” US District Judge David J. Hale said in his ruling. The law banned healthcare providers from prescribing treatments like puberty blockers and hormone therapy to most minors. The law also barred gender-affirming surgeries on minors who have not been diagnosed with an intersex condition. The plaintiffs in the case were seven transgender minors and their parents who sued the state over the law arguing that it violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Senate Bill 150 called for healthcare providers to end treatment for patients already receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy. The bill also aimed to prevent schools from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age and allowed educators to refuse to refer to transgender students by their preferred pronouns. CNN previously reported that Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear had vetoed the bill back in March but it was overridden by Republican lawmakers. “Senate Bill 150 allows too much government interference in personal healthcare issues and rips away the freedom of parents to make medical decisions for their children,” the governor said in the statement in March. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron called the court’s decision “misguided” in a statement on Twitter. He was among the defendants named in the suit seeking to block the law from taking effect.

24,Biden says Putin has ‘absolutely’ been weakened after revolt in Russia,"President Joe Biden told CNN on Wednesday his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has “absolutely” been weakened by the short-lived mutiny over the weekend. It was his most definitive comment to date on how the rebellion by Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin affected the Russian leader’s stature. Biden and his team have been cautious in commenting on the events, wary of providing Putin pretext for claiming a western plot to oust him. But on Wednesday, Biden expanded on his views of Putin’s diminished stature. Asked whether the Russian president had been weakened, Biden said: “Absolutely.” Later, expanding on the extent of Putin’s weakness, Biden said it was difficult to ascertain. “It’s hard to tell but he’s clearly losing the war,” Biden told reporters on the White House South Lawn, mistakenly referring to the war in Iraq instead of Ukraine. “He’s losing the war at home. He’s become a bit of a pariah around the world. And it’s not just NATO, it’s not just the European Union, it’s Japan,” he added. Asked again if Putin is weaker today than he was last week, Biden said: “I know he is.” Earlier this week, Biden sought to distance the United States from the weekend rebellion in Russia, insisting in his first public remarks since the episode that the West had nothing to do with the mutiny. Still, American intelligence agencies were able to determine ahead of time that Prigozhin was preparing to challenge the Russian military, a sign of how closely the US had been monitoring tensions between Moscow and the Wagner boss. Speaking from the White House, Biden suggested it was too early to say how the situation would unfold going forward. “It’s still too early to reach a definitive conclusion about where this is going,” he said in the East Room. “The ultimate outcome of all this remains to be seen, but no matter what comes next I will keep making sure that our allies and our partners are closely aligned in how we are reading and responding to the situation.” Biden has spoken to the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy since the events over the weekend. He also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Prigozhin’s rebellion could be beneficial to Ukraine’s counteroffensive. “To the extent that Moscow is distracted by its own internal divisions, that may help,” Blinken said in an interview with MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “To the extent that the Wagner forces themselves are no longer on the front lines, that could help, because they have been effective. They just literally throw people into a meat grinder of Putin’s own making, but that’s had some effect,” Blinken continued. This story has been updated with additional reporting. ",REAL
17,Appeals court dismisses Ivanka Trump as co-defendant in civil fraud case against Donald Trump,"A New York appeals court has dismissed Ivanka Trump as a co-defendant in New York Attorney General Letitia James’ civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, his children and the Trump Organization, according to a court order filed Tuesday. James filed the lawsuit against the former US president, three of his adult children, and the Trump Organization, among others, last September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself. The court order dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump as untimely after finding that she was not a party to an August 2021 agreement between James’ office and the Trump Organization to toll the statute of limitations. “The record before us…indicates that defendant Ivanka Trump was no longer within the agreement’s definition of ‘Trump Organization’ by the date the tolling agreement was executed,” the order states. “The allegations against defendant Ivanka Trump do not support any claims that accrued after February 6, 2016. Thus, all claims against her should have been dismissed as untimely.” A spokesperson for James’ office told CNN in a statement Tuesday evening, “There is a mountain of evidence that shows Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization falsely and fraudulently valued multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for significant economic gain.” “Those facts haven’t changed. This decision allows us to hold him accountable for that fraud, and we intend to do so,” the statement said. As for the other defendants, the appellate court denied most of their arguments, but ruled that the claims against them should be dismissed unless they accrued after July 2014 for the defendants subject to the tolling agreement, or otherwise after February 2016 for the remaining defendants. The appellate court referred the case back to the trial court to “determine, if necessary, the full range of defendants bound by the [August 2021] tolling agreement.” In the more than 200-page lawsuit, James, a Democrat, alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.
